<H2>NAME</H2>

<P>
photopc - utility to control digital cameras based on Sierra Imaging firmware
<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<P>
photopc [-h] [-V] [-v[v]] [-q] [-z] [-t] [-f timeformat] [-s &lt;speed&gt;] [-S &lt;pseudo-speed&gt;] [-l &lt;device&gt;] [-u] [command [params] ] ...
<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
This is a command line tool to manipulate digital still cameras that use
certain control protocol, namely Agfa ePhoto line, Epson PhotoPC line,
Olympus D-xxxL line, Sanyo and Nikon (at least CoolPix 9xx) cameras.  It
can set camera parameters, download and erase pictures, e.t.c.  It was
originally developed for Epson PhotoPC 500, now the author uses it with
Olympus D-600L, results with other models may vary.
<P>
<P>

<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
This option produces a help screen of all options and commands.
<P>
<DT><B>-V</B>

<DD>
This option prints software revision information.
<P>
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
This option enables verbose output. Using two -v options increases the
level of verbosity. This is primarily meant for debugging.
<P>
<DT><B>-q</B>

<DD>
This option sets quiet mode.  If it is not specified, the program will
show running download progress indicator.
<P>
<DT><B>-z</B>

<DD>
This option sets no time-zone processing mode.  Use this option if the
camera's clock is (should be) set up shifted by the local timezone
offset.
<P>
<DT><B>-s speed</B>

<DD>
This option allows setting the data rate to use when communicating with
the camera.  Valid rates are 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 and 115200 (the
default).
<P>




<DT><B>-S speed</B>

<DD>
On some UNIX systems with some serial hardware/driver combinations you
need to &quot;lie&quot; to the driver about the communication speed that you want
to use at startup and during the session.  Physical startup speed is
always 19200.  E.g., if on your system speeds up to 19200 are translated
one to one, but in order to use 57600 baud you have to specify 50 baud,
and you want to run at 57600, you'll need to specify
<B>photopc -s57600 -S19200,50</B>

<I>&lt;commands ...&gt;</I>

<P>
Another example: if your driver will use physical speed four times
as high as you told it to set, and you want to run at default 115200
physical speed, specify
<B>photopc -S4800,28800</B>

<I>&lt;commands ...&gt;</I>

<P>
<DT><B>-t</B>

<DD>
Set timestamp of generated files to the time of snapshot.
<P>
<DT><B>-f timeformat</B>

<DD>
This option allows to specify the format for automatically generated
image file names; the value is used as the format string for strftime (3)
function.  By default, names of the format &quot;MMDD_NNN.jpg&quot; are generated,
where MM is a month, DD is a day, and NNN is a count starting from 001.
A good starting point for the timeformat value could be
&quot;%Y_%m_%d-%H_%M_%S.jpg&quot;.  If the format string contains context &quot;%%XXXd&quot;
where XXX are digits, it is taken for the count, i.e. if the file with
such name is present, next count is tried.  If the format string does
not contain &quot;%%XXXd&quot; part, the count field, if necessary, is appended at
the end of the name.
<P>
A few single-character formats are used as shortcuts.  &quot;x&quot; makes the
name of seconds since the epoch in hexadecimal format (8 characters +
&quot;.jpg&quot;), &quot;d&quot; - the same in decimal format (10 characters), &quot;1&quot; stands
for default format &quot;%m%d_%%03d.jpg&quot;, &quot;2&quot; stands for &quot;%y%m%d%%02d.jpg&quot;,
&quot;3&quot; stands for &quot;%Y_%m_%d-%H_%M_%S.jpg&quot; and 4 stands for
&quot;%Y/%m/%d/%H_%M_%S.jpg&quot;.  The program attempts to create intermediate
directories if necessary (and possible).
<P>
<DT><B>-l device</B>

<DD>
This allows specifying the serial device to use for communicating with
the camera. The default is
<I>/dev/photopc</I>

(which is typically created as
a (symbolic) link to the real device, e.g. /dev/ttyS0) in UNIX, and
<I>COM1:</I>

in DOS and Windows.  Note that the program does not use UUCP style locks
so you need to be certain that no other program, such as uugetty,
uucico or mouse manager, is trying to access the same device.
<P>
<DT><B>-u</B>

<DD>
Use Universal Serial Bus (USB) if available.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMANDS</H2>

<P>
After the options, one or more commands can be given in the command line.
<P>
Some commands accept
<B>frame-list</B>

as a parameter.  Frame list is a comma-separated list of tokens (no
whitespace allowed), each of the tokens being a word
<B>all</B>,

or a single number, or two numbers separated by a dash (-),
or a number followed by a dash and a word
<B>last</B>

(without whitespace).
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>query</B>

<DD>
Display all current camera settings.
<P>
<DT><B>count</B>

<DD>
Output the number of pictures stored in the camera.  This is intended
for use in shell scripts.
<P>
<DT><B>list</B>

<DD>
List information about frames stored in the camera.  Fields displayed
are: frame number, size of image file, protection state, resolution
mode, timestamp and filename if available.  Faster than
<B>llist</B>

but may not work with some (older) models.
<P>
WARNING: this command changes current directory on models that support
directory tree on the flash media.
<P>
<DT><B>llist</B>

<DD>
List more information about frames stored in the camera.  Fields
displayed are: frame number, protection state, size of image file,
resolution mode, flash, shutter and timestamp.  Slower than
<B>list</B>

and does not work with models that use
<I>Exif</I>

file format.
<P>
WARNING: this command changes current directory on models that support
directory tree on the flash media.
<P>
<DT><B>cd &lt;path&gt;</B>

<DD>
On the models that support multiple directories on the flash media,
change current directory as specified.
<P>
The program chdir's to the first non-empty folder at the beginning.
So, your first
<B>cd</B>

command
<I>must</I>

specify full path starting with
a slash. If it where unix you could also
<B>cd</B><I> ../something</I>

but here we do not have a way to move up one level.
<P>
<DT><B>protect &lt;frame-list&gt; On | Off</B>

<DD>
Change &quot;protected&quot; status of frames. Frame numbering starts at 1. The
command will fail if the frame number is omitted, not numeric, or does
not correspond to a stored frame.  &quot;Protected&quot; frames cannot be erased
with &quot;erase&quot; and &quot;eraseall&quot; commands or with the &quot;erase&quot; button on the
camera.
<P>
<DT><B>erase &lt;frame-list&gt;</B>

<DD>
Erase frames. Frame numbering starts at 1. The command will fail if the
frame number is omitted, not numeric, or does not correspond to a stored
frame.
<P>
To avoid unexpected results, list of frames specified for this command
is sorted and processed in reverse order.
<P>
<DT><B>eraseall</B>

<DD>
Erase all stored frames.
<P>
<DT><B>eraselast</B>

<DD>
Erase most recently taken frame.
<P>
<DT><B>snapshot</B>

<DD>
Take a picture.
<P>
<DT><B>off</B>

<DD>
Switch off the camera.  This command only has this effect on some models
(notably Olympus D-600L).  On other models, it just terminates the
session immediately (otherwise the camera would be active several
seconds after the last command).  On models with big timeout, such as
Photopc 600, it may be wise to always issue &quot;off&quot; at the end of command
row, to decrease power consumption.
<P>
All commands going after &quot;off&quot; are ignored.
<P>
<DT><B>image &lt;frame-list&gt; &lt;file-or-dir-name&gt;</B>

<DD>
Download an image or series of images from the camera to disk file(s) on
the host computer.  Frame numbering starts at 1. The command will fail
if the frame number is omitted, not numeric, or does not correspond to a
stored frame.  Files are stored in JPEG (JFIF or Exif) format.  Image
file also contains a thumbnail portion, and set of parameters like the
shutter speed, date and time, I.D. string and more.  Directory must be
specified if frame list is requested.  If directory name is specified,
downloaded file(s) will get unique names starting with month and date of
snapshot, unless -f option is used, in which case unique names according
to
<B>-f</B>

option setting.
<P>
<DT><B>thumbnail &lt;frame-list&gt; &lt;file-or-dir-name&gt;</B>

<DD>
Download a thumbnail image or series of thumbnails from the camera to
disk file(s) on the host computer. Frame numbering starts at 1. The
command will fail if the frame number is omitted, not numeric, or does
not correspond to a stored frame. Files are stored in JPEG (JFIF or Exif)
format.  If the camera does not keep files in
<I>EXIF</I>

format, then the thumbnail file also contains a set of parameters like
the shutter speed, date and time, I.D.  string and more.  Directory must
be specified if frame list is requested.  If directory name is
specified, downloaded file(s) will get unique names according to
<B>-f</B>

option setting.
<P>
<DT><B>audio &lt;frame-list&gt; &lt;file-or-dir-name&gt;</B>

<DD>
Download an audio notice file or series of files from the camera to disk
file(s) on the host computer. Frame numbering starts at 1. The command
will fail if the frame number is omitted, not numeric, or does not
correspond to a stored frame. Files are stored with &quot;.wav&quot; extention but
the format is
<I>not</I>

RIFF WAV format.  It is compressed in some way, probably with some
variation of ADPCM.  The program stores the raw data as provided by the
camera, it is not playable as a normal
<I>.wav</I>

file.  Directory must be specified if frame list is requested.  If
directory name is specified, downloaded file(s) will get unique names
according to
<B>-f</B>

option setting.
<P>
<DT><B>preview &lt;file-name&gt;</B>

<DD>
take a `preview' snapshot and save image as a &lt;file-name&gt;.  File is in
JPEG (JFIF or Exif) format, and does not contain any additional data,
just plain (very low resolution) image.
<P>
<DT><B>upload &lt;file-name&gt;</B>

<DD>
Upload image file into the camera.  This command is not enabled in
LOWMEMORY version (i.e. under MS/DOS).
<P>
<B>WARNING!</B>

You cannot upload arbitrary JPEG file.  Depending on the camera model,
such attempt may result in the image not uploaded, not viewable, or even
the camera &quot;hung&quot; needing to remove the batteries to make it work again.
File previously downloaded from the same camera model is always uploadable.
Otherwise, your milage may vary.
<B>photopc</B>

program does not perform any checks, so it's up to the user to provide
the file in proper format.
<P>
<DT><B>mode Record | Play | Thumbnail</B>

<DD>
Set specified operation mode on certain models.
<P>
<DT><B>resolution Hi | Lo | Ext | &lt;number&gt;</B>

<DD>
Set the camera to high, low or extended resolution mode.  Exact meaning
of the modes is model-dependant and may specify different image
dimensions and/or JPEG compression rate.
<P>
<DT><B>clock</B>

<DD>
Set the camera's internal real-time clock using the current date and
time from the host computer.  Time of taking a snapshot is included
inside the JPEG files produced.  Note that the models which display
the time on the LCD will then display GMT rather than local time.
With
<B>-z</B>

option, time shifted by the timezone offset is set, and the LCD will
display local time.  Using unshifted (GMT) time in the camera seems a
proper way to go.
<P>
<DT><B>shutter &lt;speed&gt;</B>

<DD>
Set the camera shutter speed.  Units can be specified in microseconds or
in traditional form like &quot;1/250&quot;.  Valid interval depends on the model.
If a value outside the interval is specified, the camera will set the
speed to the nearest margin of the valid interval.  Special speed value
<B>auto</B>

will set automatic shutter.  Note that this only works while the camera
is connected to the host, and automatically turns the flash off.  While
disconnected, shutter speed is always set automatically.
<P>
<DT><B>aperture Auto | Lo | Med | Hi</B>

<DD>
Set the lense aperture on models that support it.
<P>
<DT><B>flash Auto | Force | Off | AntiRedeye | SlowSync</B>

<DD>
Set the camera flash mode.
<P>
<DT><B>id &lt;string&gt;</B>

<DD>
Set the camera identifier string that is included inside the JPEG files
produced.  Only few models support this.
<P>
<DT><B>autoshut-host &lt;seconds&gt;</B>

<DD>
Automatically shut off the camera after that many seconds of inactivity
while connected to the computer (on the host).
<P>
<DT><B>autoshut-field &lt;seconds&gt;</B>

<DD>
Automatically shut off the camera after that many seconds of inactivity
while disconnected from the computer (in the field).
<P>
<DT><B>lcd-autoshut &lt;seconds&gt;</B>

<DD>
Automatically shut off the LCD monitor after that many seconds of inactivity.
<P>
<DT><B>lcd-brightness &lt;value&gt;</B>

<DD>
Set LCD brightness to the value (valid values are 1 to 7).
<P>
<DT><B>focus Macro | Normal | Infinity</B>

<DD>
Set the lens focusing mode.  As far as I can tell, on fixed focus models
macro only means force minimum aperture, not change the focal length.
Only has effect in the same invocation with &quot;snapshot&quot; command.
<P>
<DT><B>adjust Normal | Contrast+ | Contrast- | Brightness+ | Brightness-</B>

<DD>
Set adjustment of picture brightness/contrast.
<P>
<DT><B>metering Center-weighted | Spot | Matrix</B>

<DD>
Set auto exposure metering mode.
<P>
<DT><B>whitebalance Normal | Sunny | Incandescent | Fluorescent | Flash | Preset | Cloudy</B>

<DD>
Set white balance.
<P>
<DT><B>color On | Off</B>

<DD>
Set color or B/W mode.
<P>
<DT><B>dzoom On | Off | &lt;number&gt;</B>

<DD>
Set digital zoom on or off.  Note that low resolution must be set prior
to turning on digital zoom.  Numeric values have model-dependant meaning.
Only has effect in the same invocation with &quot;snapshot&quot; command.
<P>
<DT><B>zoom &lt;mm&gt;</B>

<DD>
Set optical zoom value on models that support it.

<H2>KNOWN BUGS</H2>

<P>
On some models, powersaving timeouts are measured not in seconds but in
1/10 sec units.  The program reports them as in seconds.
<P>
Llist command relies on the format of thumbnail image that does not
contain necessary information on some models (e.g. Nikon CP 900), this
command does not work for these models.  List command, on the contrary,
do not display useful data on models that do not return it in the
register 47 (e.g. Agfa 780).
<P>
The program is known to have some timing problems talking to Nikon CP900
when the camera is &quot;napping&quot; in powersaving mode.  Until the problem is
solved, a workaround is to run the program this way:
<P>
<B>$ photopc &amp;&amp; photopc</B>

<I>&lt;command list&gt;</I>

<P>
Nikon seem to have some other problems too, especially when doing
&quot;actions&quot; (e.g. snapshots, erase).
<P>
Another Nikon problem: if 32Mb (or bigger?) memry card is inserted, the
program cannot get the number of frames taken, and if &quot;all&quot; or &quot;NN-last&quot;
range is specified for downloading, the program fails.  Specify explicit
range of frames.  Also, with any card, number of frames taken is not
updated immediately after the &quot;snapshot&quot; command (the same has been
reported for other models).  If you find how to find the correct number
of frames, please let me know.
