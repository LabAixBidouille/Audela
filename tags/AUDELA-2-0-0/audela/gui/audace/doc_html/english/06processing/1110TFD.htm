<h1>Discrete Fourier Transform</h1>
<p>The <b>Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)</b> translates a
spatial-domain image into two frequency (or Fourier) domain images.
Mathematically speaking, this a complex transformation. So, depending
on the output format, the frequency domain images will be different :
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <em>Cartesian</em> format : the first output image will contain
the <b>real part</b> of the DFT, while the second image will contain
the <b>imaginary part</b>. The real part image will be an "even"
image, as it shows some symetries with respect to the images axes. And
the imaginary part image will be an "odd" image.</li>
  <li> <em>Polar</em> format : the first output image will contain the
    <b>modulus</b> of the DFT, the second one the <b>argument</b>. The
modulus image can be considered as the root square of the power
spectrum of the original image. Hence it is a "even" image, while the
other is an "odd" one.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the <em>order</em> parameter, one can choose where frequencies
are located in the resulting files :
</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Centered</em> : The DFT <b>low frequencies</b> are gathered
in the center neigthborhood of the image. The FITS header is updated
with the DFT_ORD keyword which parameter is the string <em>CENTERED</em>.</li>
  <li><em>Regular</em> : The DFT <b>high frequencies</b> are gathered
in the center neigthborhood of the image. The FITS header is updated
with the DFT_ORD keyword which parameter is the string <em>REGULAR</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The user may choose to process the displayed image, or to process a
file stored on a hard disk.<br>
When processing the previously displayed image, two resulting files
will be created which names will depend on the selected format<span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>.
If the format is set to <span style="font-style: italic;">polar</span>,
the files will be named as "<span style="font-style: italic;">modulus.fit</span>"
and "<span style="font-style: italic;">argument.fit</span>". If the
format is set to <span style="font-style: italic;">cartesian</span>,
the names will be "<span style="font-style: italic;">real.fit</span>"
and "<span style="font-style: italic;">imaginary.fit</span>". <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">If there were some files with the
very same names, their content will be overridden</span>.<br>
If the user prefers to directly work on file, he will be able to select
the names of the resulting files.<br>
In both cases, when the processing is complete, the displayed image is
the first output image, i.e., depending on the selected format, the
real part or the modulus of the DFT operator.</p>
<p>The output images are encoded into unsigned 16-bits words. As the
DFT result is signed, pixels values are shifted and normalised to fit
the [0-32767] interval. The keywords <em>DFT_OFFS</em> and <em>DFT_NORM</em>
contain respectively the shift and normalisation values.
