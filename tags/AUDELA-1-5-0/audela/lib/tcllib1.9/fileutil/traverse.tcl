snit::type ::fileutil::traverse {

    # Incremental directory traversal.

    # API
    # create  %AUTO% basedirectory options... -> object
    # next    filevar                         -> boolean
    # foreach filevar script
    # files                                   -> list (path ...)

    # Options
    # -prefilter command-prefix
    # -filter    command-prefix
    # -errorcmd  command-prefix

    # Use cases
    #
    # (a) Basic incremental
    # - Create and configure a traversal object.
    # - Execute 'next' to retrieve one path at a time,
    #   until the command returns False, signaling that
    #   the iterator has exhausted the supply of paths.
    #   (The path is stored in the named variable).
    #
    # The execution of 'next' can be done in a loop, or via event
    # processing.

    # (b) Basic loop
    # - Create and configure a traversal object.
    # - Run a script for each path, using 'foreach'.
    #   This is a convenient standard wrapper around 'next'.
    #
    # The loop properly handles all possible Tcl result codes.

    # (c) Non-incremental, non-looping.
    # - Create and configure a traversal object.
    # - Retrieve a list of all paths via 'files'.

    # The -prefilter callback is executed for directories. Its result
    # determines if the traverser recurses into the directory or not.
    # The default is to always recurse into all directories. The call-
    # back is invoked with a single argument, the path of the
    # directory.
    #
    # The -filter callback is executed for all paths. Its result
    # determines if the current path is a valid result, and returned
    # by 'next'. The default is to accept all paths as valid. The
    # callback is invoked with a single argument, the path to check.

    # The -errorcmd callback is executed for all paths the traverser
    # has trouble with. Like being unable to cd into them, get their
    # status, etc. The default is to ignore any such problems. The
    # callback is invoked with a two arguments, the path for which the
    # error occured, and the error message. Errors thrown by the
    # filter callbacks are handled through this callback too. Errors
    # thrown by the error callback itself are not caught and ignored,
    # but allowed to pass to the caller, usually of 'next'.

    # Note: Low-level functionality, version and platform dependent is
    # implemented in procedures, and conditioally defined for optimal
    # use of features, etc. ...

    # Note: Traversal is done in depth-first pre-order.

    # Note: The options are handled only during
    # construction. Afterward they are read-only and attempts to
    # modify them will cause the system to throw errors.
