Tcl-DP - Things to know before mailing us
-----------------------------------------

Mail
----

Do not mail anyone besides "tcl-dp@cs.cornell.edu".  Do not email
the individual authors.  We will terminate your mail with extreme
prejudice.


Compiling
---------

In Unix, Tcl-DP uses Tcl's settings for compilation.  Assuming Tcl
compiled fine, DP should compile fine.  If you want to compile DP
with gcc, you must compile Tcl with gcc first by using
"configure --enable-gcc" when configuring Tcl.


Installation
------------

Installation is done via a new utility we have written called Teki.
Teki will keep track of any Tcl packages and automatically install
or uninstall them.  There are no command line arguments.

You cannot use the Makefile to install DP.  You will be cursed by the gods
if you try.


Basic Tcl-DP script tips
------------------------

If you are using tclsh to run a server script, you should have
something like the following:

set server [dp_MakeRPCServer $port]
vwait forever

The vwait is essential since tclsh does not automatically handle
asynchronous events.  Note that wish does and thus does not need
the vwait.


To shutdown the server, connect a client and execute:

dp_RDO $client set forever 1

This will cause the server to exit the event loop, the script will
finish and Tcl will automatically close the channel.
