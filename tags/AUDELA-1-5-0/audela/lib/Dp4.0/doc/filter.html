<p><b>Comments</b></p>

<p>Arguments:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
    <li><i>channel_name</i> is the name of an already existing
        channel (the subordinated channel), whose input and/or
        output will be filtered. Using filters, an unlimited
        number of channels can be composed to form a linear chain
        that transparently performs complex functions (e.g.
        sequencing, encrypting/decrypting, transcoding,
        etc.).&nbsp;</li>
    <li><i>filter_name</i> is the name of a registered filter
        function (see below). Neither the value for -infilter,
        nor for -outfilter is mandatory. If they are missing, the
        corresponding filter function will be <b>identity</b>.</li>

    <dt><b>Description of Filter Functions</b></dt>
    <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
    <dd>Prototype: <tt>int Filter (char *inBuf, int inLength,
        char **outBuf, int *outLength, void **data, Tcl_Interp
        *interp, int mode)&nbsp;</tt><p>Arguments: We provide
        below the parameters' default interpretation. For the
        other cases, please refer to the description of the mode
        parameter below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(in) <tt>inBuf</tt>: Points to the start of the
                input buffer. It is assumed that the filter
                consumes the entire input. If it is not possible
                to generate filtered output for all the input
                data, part of it can be buffered
                internally.&nbsp;The responsability of freeing
                the buffer always pertains to the <font size="3"
                face="Courier New">DP</font> code, and not to the
                filter.</li>
            <li>(in) <tt>inLength</tt>: The length of the input
                buffer.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>(out) <tt>outBuf</tt>: Whenever the filter will
                generate output, the address of the buffer must
                be stored in <font size="2" face="Courier New">*outbuf</font>.
                The parameter is ignored by the <font
                face="Courier New">DP</font> code when <font
                size="2" face="Courier New">*outLength</font> is
                set to 0. Unless the value of mode is <font
                face="Courier New">DP_FILTER_GET</font>, it is
                the responsability of the <font
                face="Courier New">DP</font> code to manage the
                buffer. When mode is <font face="Courier New">DP_FILTER_GET</font>,
                it is the responsability of the filter function
                to manage the buffer.</li>
            <li>(out) <tt>outLength</tt>: The length of the
                output buffer. If there is no output, <font
                size="2" face="Courier New">*outLength</font>
                must be set to 0.</li>
            <li>(in) <font size="2" face="Courier New">data</font>:
                If filter functions need persistent state
                associated with the streams they filter, they can
                store a pointer to these structures in <font
                size="2" face="Courier New">*data</font>. Before
                the first call to the filter function, the
                plug-in channel code initializes <font size="2"
                face="Courier New">*data</font> with <font
                face="Courier New">NULL</font>. The filter
                function has full responsability in managing the
                memory zone pointed to by <font size="2"
                face="Courier New">*data.</font> In particular,
                the filter should free all the allocated space
                when the value of the mode parameter is <font
                face="Courier New">DP_FILTER_CLOSE.</font></li>
            <li>(in) <font size="2" face="Courier New">interp</font>:
                Pointer to the tcl interpreter in which the
                filter channel was created. It can be used to
                create filters that evaluate arbitrary tcl
                expressions (see, for example. the tclfilter
                function below).</li>
            <li>(in) <tt>mode</tt>: This parameter specifies how
                the other arguments must be interpreted. Unless
                specified otherwise, the default interpretation
                of the other parameters must be used.</li>
            <li><ul>
                    <li><tt>DP_FILTER_NORMAL</tt>: The <font
                        size="2" face="Courier New">mode</font>
                        parameter will have this value when the <font
                        size="2" face="Courier New">-buffering</font>
                        option of the filter channel has been set
                        to <font size="2" face="Courier New">line</font>
                        or <font size="2" face="Courier New">full</font>.</li>
                    <li><tt>DP_FILTER_FLUSH</tt>: The filter is <font
                        size="2" face="Courier New">encouraged</font>
                        to generate output, even if this would
                        not normally be the case. The filter can
                        ignore this argument and behave like <font
                        size="2" face="Courier New">mode</font>
                        was <tt>DP_FILTER_NORMAL</tt>. The mode
                        parameter will have this value when the <font
                        size="2" face="Courier New">-buffering</font>
                        option of the filter channel has been set
                        to <font size="2" face="Courier New">none</font>.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><dl>
                            <dt><font face="Courier New">DP_FILTER_EOF</font>:
                                This value of the parameter
                                signals that no more data will be
                                received from the subordinated
                                channel. At this point, the
                                filter function must generate all
                                the output it can, and free all
                                its internal buffers.</dt>
                        </dl>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li><tt>DP_FILTER_CLOSE</tt>: This value of
                        the parameter signals that the filter
                        channel is about to be closed, and this
                        is the last call to the filter function.
                        The filter must deallocate all its
                        internal data structures, and generate
                        all the output it can.</li>
                    <li><tt>DP_FILTER_SET</tt>: All parameters
                        are ignored, except for <font size="2"
                        face="Courier New">inBuf</font> and <font
                        size="2" face="Courier New">inLength</font>.
                        In this case the input buffer is a string
                        that is passed &quot;as is&quot; by Tcl
                        from the <font size="2"
                        face="Courier New">fconfigure
                        &lt;channel&gt; -[inset | outset]
                        &lt;string&gt;</font> command. The filter
                        function can use the string to set its
                        internal variables. For example, this
                        mechanism could be used to set a
                        different pgp key for each channel.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><tt>DP_FILTER_GET</tt>: All parameters
                        are ignored, except for <font size="2"
                        face="Courier New">outBuf</font>. The
                        filter function must store in <font
                        size="2" face="Courier New">*outBuf</font>
                        the address of a null-terminated string
                        that describes its internal state. The
                        string is read only once by <font
                        face="Courier New">DP</font>, immediately
                        after the filter returns. This is the
                        only case when the filter function has to
                        manage the memory zone whose address was
                        stored in *outbuf; which is done to avoid
                        unnecessary reconstructions of the state
                        string.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Return value: If no error is detected, the return
        value must be zero. A non-zero return value signals an
        error, if needed, <font size="2" face="Courier New">POSIX</font>
        error codes can be used to indicate the type of the
        error.</p>
        <p>Before being used, a filter function has to be
        registered by calling function <tt>Dp_RegisterPlugInFilter</tt>.
        <tt>TCL_OK</tt> is returned upon successful completion of
        registration.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Prototype: <tt>int Dp_RegisterPlugInFilter (Tcl_Interp
        interp, Dp_PlugInFilter *newPlugInPtr)&nbsp;</tt></p>
        <p>Arguments:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>interp</em> is the pointer to the interpreter
                in which the registration wil take place&nbsp;</li>
            <li><em>newPlugInPtr</em> is a pointer to a filter
                function defined as specified above.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Filter functions can also be pre-registered, by adding
        them to the array <b>builtInPlugs</b><i> </i>in file <b>generic/dpChan.c</b>,
        and recompiling Tcl-DP. As of now, the following plug-in
        filters are provided (unless specified otherwise, the
        filters have no internal parameters):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>identity: Used as default value for a filter
                function that was not defined explicitly.
                Property: identity(X) = X.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>plug1to2: The input string is filtered by
                replacing each character of the string with two
                copies of itself. Example:
                Plug1to2(&quot;abc&quot;) = &quot;aabbcc&quot;.</li>
            <li>plug2to1: The input string is filtered by
                selecting the characters that have even indices.
                Example: Plug2to1(&quot;abcdef&quot;) =
                &quot;ace&quot;.</li>
            <li>xor: An arbitrary, non-empty parameter string has
                to be provided as an internal argument before
                first using the filter. The input bytes will be
                xor'd with the bytes in the parameter, taken in
                circular order. This order will be preserved
                between succesive calls. The same string must be
                used for both encoding and decoding. Example:
                xor(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;12&quot;) = xyz, where
                x = 'a' ^ '1', y = 'b' ^ '2', z = 'c' ^ '1'.</li>
            <li>packon: Adds a header of 6 bytes to each packet
                that is written to or read from the underlying
                channel. The header contains a right-aligned
                nonnegative integer in base 10; the integer is
                padded to the left with non-significant zeroes.
                Normally a packet is the amount of data that is
                written to (read from) the underlying channel at
                one time. (Note: If the amount of data is bigger
                than the capacity of Tcl's internal buffers
                (usually 4k), spurious packets will be
                generated.) Example: packon(&quot;abc&quot;) =
                &quot;000003abc&quot;.</li>
            <li>uuencode: Same functionality as Unix uuencode;
                converts a binary file into a specially formatted
                file containg a subset of the ASCII character
                set. Example: uuencode(&quot;abc&quot;) =
                &quot;begin 740 uufilter\n$86C&quot;O\\\n\n
                \nend\n&quot; ('\n' stands for line feed, and
                '\\'stands for backslash).</li>
            <li>uudecode: Same functionality as Unix uudecode.
                Example: uudecode(&quot;begin 740
                uufilter\n$86C&quot;O\\\n\n \nend\n&quot;) =
                &quot;abc&quot;.</li>
            <li><dl>
                    <dt>tclfilter: Allows the user to use any tcl
                        function to implement a filter. The tcl
                        filter takes two arguments, and is
                        assumed to consume the whole input (and
                        buffer it, if necessary). The first
                        argument is the (possibly zero-length)
                        input string, The second argument can
                        only have the values &quot;normal&quot;,
                        &quot;flush&quot;, &quot;close&quot;,
                        &quot;eof&quot; and corresponds to the
                        mode <font size="2" face="Courier New">parameter</font>
                        above. The output value is a (possibly
                        zero-length) string that represents the
                        first use. Arguments: the name of the tcl
                        procedure must be set up before the first
                        use.</dt>
                </dl>
            </li>
            <li>hexout: Given a string of even length containing
                the characters 0..9, a..f, A..F this filter
                translates it into a sequence of bytes whose
                hexadecimal representation is the given string.
                Example: hexout(&quot;00Ff&quot;) will generate
                two bytes, the first one having all bits set to
                zero, the second one having all bites set to 1.</li>
            <li><dl>
                    <dt>hexin: Has the opposite effect to hexout.</dt>
                </dl>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p><b>Filters as Independent Channels</b></p>

<p>When some peculiar requirement or Tcl's idiosyncracies make it
inconvenient or impossible to implement some filters using
plug-in channels, one can obtain the desired functionality by
creating a standalone filter channel. We provide two such
examples:</p>

<p>identity: This channel reproduces the functionality of the
identity plug-in filter. It is provided as a skeleton that can be
modified to implement more complex filters. This channel does not
accept any non-standard options. Note: do not confuse the
identity (standalone) filter channel with the identity filter
function.</p>

<p>packoff: This filter identifies packets generated by the
packon plug-in filter (see above) and separates them from the
input stream, returning them separately. Since this operation
makes sense only when reading data, this channel is not writable.
This channel does not accept any non-standard options.</p>

<p><b>Properties of the Provided In-Built Filter Functions</b></p>

<p>Plug1to2(Plug2to1(X)) = X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plug2to1(Plug1to2(X)) = X.&nbsp;</p>

<p>xor(xor(X,Y),Y) = X.</p>

<p>packon(packoff(X)) = packoff(packon(X)).</p>

<p>uudecode(uuencode(X)) = X.</p>

<p>hexin(hexout(X)) = X</p>

<p>hexout(hexin(X)) = X</p>

<p>hexin(hexout(X)) != hexout(hexin(X))</p>

<p><b>Order of Operations</b></p>

<p>When flushing or closing a sequence of channels linked through
filters, one should follow the flow of data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Example: filter1--&gt;filter2--&gt;TCP_channel&nbsp;</p>

<p>When closing this composite channel the sequence of operations
should be&nbsp;</p>

<p><tt>close $filter1<br>
close $filter2<br>
close $tcp_channel</tt></p>

<p><b>Configuration of Filter Channels&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The subordinated channel and the input and output filter
functions of a filter channel can not be changed.</p>

<p>The peek option is forwarded to the subordinated channel, but
it does not act on the filter channel itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two options, <font size="2" face="Courier New">-inset</font>
and <font size="2" face="Courier New">-outset</font>, that can be
used to transmit arguments to the input and output filter
functions, respectively. The argument of <font size="2"
face="Courier New">-inset</font> and <font size="2"
face="Courier New">-outset</font> is a string that will be passed
to the corresponding filter function &quot;as is&quot;. It is the
responsability of the filter function to interpret the
string.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the user wishes to change an option for the subordinated
channel, this must be done directly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A filter channel will always be non-blocking. Seek is not
allowed. A plug-in filter channel will always be both readable
and writeable, but the real behavior will depend on the
characteristics of the internal buffering of filter functions,
and on the behavior of the subordinated channel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note: though tcl itself can not handle binary data, the
plug-in filters can. Care must be taken to set the <font size="2"
face="Courier New">-translation </font>option to binary for the
appropriate channels.</p>

<p><b>Composition of Filters</b></p>

<p>Both plug-in and independent channel filters can be composed
with no restrictions.</p>

<p><b>Examples&nbsp;</b></p>

<dl>
    <dt><tt>dp_connect plugfilter -channel tcp1 -infilter
        plug2to1 -outfilter plug1to2<br>
        <br>
        dp_connect plugfilter -channel email0 -outfilter pgp
        -infilter un_pgp<br>
        <br>
        set xout [dp_connect plugfilter -channel file540
        -outfilter uuencode<br>
        fconfigure $xout -translation binary<br>
        set xxout [dp_connect plugfilter -channel $xout
        -outfilter xor]<br>
        fconfigure $xxout -translation binary -outset &quot;my
        secret string goes here&quot;<br>
        <br>
        set xin [dp_connect plugfilter -channel file100 -infilter
        tclfilter]<br>
        fconfigure $xin -inset MyTclProcedure<br>
        <br>
        dp_connect packoff -channel tcp10</tt></dt>
