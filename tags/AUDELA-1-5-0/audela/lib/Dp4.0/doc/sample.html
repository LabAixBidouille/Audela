<h3>Sample Applications</h3>

<p>As an trivial example of what Tcl-DP can do, we have included
several samples of how one can use Tcl-DP. In the <strong>examples</strong>
subdirectory, there is:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A Tk whiteboard application</li>
    <li>An FTP-like protocol for file transfer between two Tcl
        interpreters</li>
    <li>A group text conferencing system and, of course,</li>
    <li>Tic-Tac-Toe</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the whiteboard and conferencing system would both
benefit by switching the network protocol from TCP to IPM but
since dp_MakeRPC{Server,Client} both use TCP, that task is left
to the reader.</p>
