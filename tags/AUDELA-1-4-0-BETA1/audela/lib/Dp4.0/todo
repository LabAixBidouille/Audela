Add a better security model.  It would be nice to have 3.5's ability to check
every line of an RPC as it is executed rather than a one-time check.

HP9 fails TCP buffer tests.  I don't think the system will allow a socket
    buffer < 8192 bytes.

Several UDP tests fail in Windows.

Sending a large (20k+) RPC hangs in Windows.

Better documentation of obscure feature like oo.tcl.

Abstract Teki so that both text- and GUI-installs are possible.
