   * Allow Long Long type (64 bits integer) in Windows.
   * Allow the switching of different set of WCS (WCSn, where n is a, b, c..) information.
   * Add routines to extract WCS header information.

=====================================================================

July, 2006: Release of fitsTcl v2.1.5 (part of fv4.4)

   * Fix incorrect calculation of Table array size of a FITS file.

=====================================================================

March, 2006: Release of fitsTcl v.2.1.4 (part of fv4.3)

   * Add region statistical calculation

=====================================================================
April 5th, 2005: Release of fitsTcl v.2.1.3 (part of fv4.2)

   * Change calling routine parameters to cfitsio
   * Fix TSTRING column length calculation (previous set to 80)

=====================================================================
August 9, 2004: Release of fitsTcl v.2.1.2 (part of fv4.1.4)

   * Fix CAR projection

=====================================================================
April 19, 2004: Release of fitsTcl v.2.1.1 (part of fv4.1.2)

   * Seperate cfitsio package from fitsTcl package.

=====================================================================
November 9, 2000: Release of fitsTcl v2.1 (part of fv3.0)

   * Added smooth command.  Currently only supports a boxcar filter.

   * Added range command.  Currently only has a "count" option which
     takes a range string (eg, 1-4,7,9-) and counts how many rows are
     included.

   * Added -rows parameter to "load expr".  This allows calculations to
     be performed on a subset of rows.

   * Replace fitsTcl's histogramming code with call to CFITSIO's
     better implementation.  Add new command 'histogram' which replaces
     the 'create 1dhisto' and 'create 2dhisto' and deprecate the latter.
     New command supports up to 4D histograms and inverse weighting.

   * Convert fitsObjn entry point to use Tcl_Objs instead of strings.
     Was able to get full precision data, but lost it when putting it.
     About half of file commands converted, rest have all parameters
     converted to strings in fitsDispatch.

   * Dropped/Ignore numElem parameter to 'put image'.  Can get number
     of elements from data list.

   * When "put"ting data to a complex column, single numbers will be
     interpretted as real only... imaginary part is zero

   * Added an optional rowList parameter to "get vtable"

   * Added -noformat option to "load tblock", "get table", and "get vtable"
     so that one can obtain raw values, not formatted strings.

   * Modified "get image" and "load iblock" routines so that they use
     native Tcl_Obj's instead of DString's for return values... allows
     full precision instead of truncated formats in real values->string
     conversion.

   * Revised wcs code to support CD matrix keywords and be more general.
     "-m" flag to 'get wcs' command will return WCS information as...
          {refVals} {refPix} {matrix} {types} {projections}
     Old-style keywords will be converted to this.  New-style will be
     converted to old-style in absence of "-m".  New-style not limited
     to 2D images or only 2 columns... can be 1 thru N-dimensions.

========================================================================

February 7, 2000: Release of fitsTcl v2.002 (part of fv2.6 and FTOOLS 5.0)

   * Modified histogram code so that it writes the column names into
     the CTYPEn keywords if the columns did not have TCTYPn keywords.

   * Add optional wcsSwap to return list of 'get wcs' command to flag
     whether the RA and Dec WCS keywords are swapped with regard to X
     and Y.  Use 'fits option wcsSwap 1|0' to toggle this parameter on
     or off. (Default: off... old behavior)

   * Add new 'fits option' command which allows one to alter fitsTcl's
     default behaviors.

   * Cast all argv's to "char *const[]" to protect them from accidental
     modification.

   * Modify 'load image' to conform to vtable/column's default NULL
     handling... NULLS are converted to datatype_MAX.  Formerly converted
     to -1.

   * Modify 'load vtable' to accept a default Null parameter.  This breaks
     backwards compatibility (it used to take a vector column width at
     the same position, but ignored in v2.0).

   * Modify 'get wcs' defaults to match CFITSIO's new implementation of
     them: 1.0 for xinc/yinc and 0.0 for all others.  Keep ctype='none',
     although CFITSIO uses a null string.

========================================================================

July 28, 1999: Release of fitsTcl v2.0

   * Major rewrite of internal code, while keeping as backwards
     compatible as possible with last fv release.  Update
     documentation and create this Release Notes document.

   * Change method of passing address pointers... Instead of using %ld
     to read and write addresses to/from strings, use the much more
     appropriate %p format.  NOTE: This is *NOT* compatible with %ld
     formats.  You must change any code dependent on fitsTcl in this
     regard!  (Or change all '%p' strings in fitsTcl back to '%ld'.)

   * Drop 'get imageblock' which was actually identical to 'load iblock'.
     'get' commands should return lists of data, which 'get imageblock'
     did not.  (Still exists for backwards compatibility, but removed from
     docs.)

   * Add new 'get image' command which returns list of data from an image
     array.

   * Rename 'put ihd/ahd/bhd' to 'insert image/table' which makes
     more sense.  New version drops the numCols parameter and allows some
     parameters to be empty.  (Again, old commands still exist but
     undocumented.)

   * Make many more trailing parameters optional

   * Convert some series of parameters to lists (eg,
     'get keyword keyName ...' becomes 'get keyword keyList')

   * Add/improve support for long keywords using new HIERARCH notation.

   * Eliminate (ignore if present) the object type parameter from the
     'free' command and accept a list of addresses to free.

   * Add general 'fits free addList' command to replace the
     fitsObj-dependent free command.

   * Add 'fits version' command to get fitsTcl and cfitsio version numbers.

   * Replace 'get imgwcs' and 'get colwcs' with a single 'get wcs'
     command which behaves appropriately based on the CHDU type.
     Error-handling behavior (ie, use of default values) is consistent,
     unlike the separate versions.  (Old commands exist, but undocumntd.)

   * Add 2 new commands for creating/reading 'load'ed data: lst2ptr and
     ptr2lst.  The former takes a TCL list and creates a pointer able to
     be passed to C code (eg, POW).  The latter reverses the conversion,
     taking a pointer and producing a TCL list.

   * Add new vector math command: vexpr.  It takes a C-style arithmetic
     expression and evaluates it in the context of TCL lists (or fitsTcl
     pointers).  Returns results as either a TCL list or fitsTcl pointer.
