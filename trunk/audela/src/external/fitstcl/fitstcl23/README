   fitsTcl is a TCL interface to the CFITSIO astronomical library
   which provides access to FITS data files.  It can be used either by
   itself within the standard tcl/tk applications tclsh and wish, or
   within the fv software package also distributed by the HEASARC at
   NASA Goddard.

   The fitsTcl User's Guide is located in the fitsTcl.html file
   distributed with fitsTcl2.1.1 and located on the web at:

        http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftools/fv/fitsTcl.html

   Send any bug reports to ftoolshelp@athena.gsfc.nasa.gov.

   fitsTcl can be built under Unix/Linux (PowerPC or Intel), MacOS,
   and Windows.  You will need a version of Tcl8.x, available either
   from Scriptics (www.scriptics.com) or HEASARC as part of the fv
   distribution (heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftools/fv).  Read the following
   for instructions for building on each platform.

   To build the fitsTcl shared library do the following:

      1.  Unpack the compressed fitsTcl tar file and enter the fitsTcl2.1.1
          directory.

      2.  Download the latest version of the cfitsio source code (for UNIX)
          from:

          http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/fitsio/fitsio.html

          and unpack the source tar file.

      3.  Configure fitsTcl for your system with the command

             ./configure [optional arguments]

          where the optional arguments are:

             --prefix=DIR1 --with-cfitsio=DIR2 --with-tcl-includes=DIR3

             DIR1 is the installation path (default is /usr/local)

             DIR2 is the path to the cfitsio source directory
                  (default is ./cfitsio)

             DIR3 is the path to the location of the tcl.h header file
                  (default is $prefix/include or /usr/include).

          These may be considered optional only if the defaults are valid
          for your system/setup.

          The final library will be installed in the directory DIR1/lib
          which must exist.  Note that the library itself does not depend
          on the value of DIR1, only the installation step in the Makefile.

      4.  Build fitsTcl with the command

             make

      5.  Install fitsTcl either with the command

             make install

          which will place it in the DIR1/lib directory, or move the
          library (libfitstcl.so, or libfitstcl.dylib under Mac OS X)
          manually to where you want it.

      To use fitsTcl, startup tclsh or wish and type the command

          load libfitstcl.so (libfitstcl.dylib on Mac OS X)

      You may need to specify an explicit path to the library or set
      the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac OS X) to its location.

   To build fitsTcl extension do the following:

      1.  Download and build the Mac TCL software available from
          Scriptics (www.scriptics.com).

      2.  Download and expand the fitsTcl distribution, which will
          create a fitsTcl2.1.1 subdirectory.

      3.  Download the latest version of the cfitsio source code from:

          http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/fitsio/fitsio.html

          and untar it under the fitsTcl2.1.1 directory (i.e. such that
          you have a fitsTcl2.1.1/cfitsio directory).

      4.  Debinhex and expand the file fitsTcl.sit.hqx, creating
          a fitsTcl folder containing a Codewarrior 5 project file,
          fitsTcl.p.

      5.  Open the new project file and update the Access Paths to
          point to your TCL source tree.

      6.  Build the 'fitsTcl DLL' target.  This will create a file
          fitsTcl.dll in the fitsTcl directory.  Move it to where ever
          is convenient and use 'load fitsTcl.dll' to load it into
          tclsh or wish.

   (Note: We do not distribute a binary version of the plugin since it
   is dependent on the major TCL version -- 8.0, 8.1, etc -- used in
   building it.  We may distribute one, though, if there is sufficient
   demand for use with a particular TCL release.)

   Building fitsTcl requires Microsoft Visual C++.  A Borland C v5
   makefile is also included, although it has not been updated since
   the last release.

   To build fitsTcl DLL do the following:

      1.  Download and build the Windows TCL software available from
          Scriptics (www.scriptics.com).

      2.  Download and expand the fitsTcl distribution, which will
          create a fitsTcl2.1.1 subdirectory.

      3.  Download the latest version of the cfitsio source code from:

          http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/fitsio/fitsio.html

          and untar it under the fitsTcl2.1.1 directory (i.e. such that
          you have a fitsTcl2.1.1/cfitsio directory).

      4.  Edit the file makefile.vc (or makefile.bc5) and update the
          paths for your specific setup.  We have our source tree at
          D:\FV_SRC.  Replace this and the TCL8.2.2 references as
          appropriate.

      5.  Type the command 'nmake -f makefile.vc'.  This will build
          a fitstcl.dll file.  Move it to where ever is convenient and
          use 'load fitstcl.dll' to load it into tclsh or wish.
