<h2>Overview</h2>

<h2>Essential Information</h2>

<h3>Using a Statefile</h3>

<p>
  Most popular browsers, including Internet Explorer and Firefox, store some
  data in the file-system. By default, Hv3 does not do this. When a browser
  window is closed, all data is discarded. This can be useful when using a
  public computer, or if you wish, for reasons of your own, to cover your
  tracks. However, it can also be inconveniant.
</p>

<p>
  The alternative is to specify the "-statefile" option as part of the
  command line used to start Hv3. The -statefile option is used to specify
  a file on disk used to persistently store various elements of the browser
  application state. Windows users may need to create a "batch file" to 
  achieve this. For example, assuming that the Hv3 binary is named
  "hv3-linux-nightly-07_0723" and you wish to use the file
  "/home/dan/hv3_state.db" as the statefile, the full command line would be:

<pre>
  hv3-linux-nightly-07_0723 -statefile /home/dan/hv3_state.db
</pre>

<p>
  If enabled, Hv3 stores the following data in the statefile:
<ul>
  <li> HTTP cookies.
  <li> The list of visited URIs (used for auto-completion in the location 
       bar and for coloring visited hyperlinks).
  <li> The values of the settings configured in the "Options" pull-down menu,
       except for the "Hide GUI" option.
  <li> User bookmarks.
</ul>

<h3>Security Considerations</h3>

<p>
  Whatever anyone else says, at time of writing all major browsers 
  have some big security issues, known and unknown. These are ours:

<ol>
<li>
<p>
  Hv3 unconditionally accepts all cookies, regardless of origin. In my
  opinion this is not a problem, but some people think it is.
</p>
<li>
<p>
  If javascript is enabled (the Options-&gt;Enable&nbsp;ECMAScript option),
  then Hv3 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. This means that
  if you visit a malicious site with javascript enabled, that site will
  be able to steal the contents of the cookies database and possibly 
  access any web-accounts that use cookies to identify users.
</p>
<p>
  Other browsers are also vulnerable to similar attacks. But it's much
  easier for a malicious user to take advantage of Hv3.
</p>
<p>
  Unless you understand all the issues involved, I strongly recommend
  that you do not test out your online banking site with Hv3.
