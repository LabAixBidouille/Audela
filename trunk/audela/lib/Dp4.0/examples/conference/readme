        Tcl-DP: N-way Text-based Conferencing Example

This example creates a conference application, similar to CB radio, 
where anyone can speak and everyone hears.

    room.tcl 	-- the conferencing server, a room where conference
                   may take place.

    enter.tcl	-- the conferencing client, that enters a room.

After setting up the room and after clients have entered that room,
clients can type "say string," as in "say hello world!," to talk to
other participants.  The server will repeat the message to all clients.
