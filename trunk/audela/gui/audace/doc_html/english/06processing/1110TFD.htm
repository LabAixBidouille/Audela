<h1>Discrete Fourier Transform</h1>
<p>The <b>Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)</b> translates a spatial-domain image into two frequency (or Fourier) domain images. Mathematically speaking, this a complex transformation. So, depending on the output format, the frequency domain images will be different :
<ul>
    <li> <em>Cartesian</em> format : the first output image will contain the <b>real part</b> of the DFT, while the second image will contain the <b>imaginary part</b>. The real part image will be an "even" image, as it shows some symetries with respect to the images axes. And the imaginary part image will be an "odd" image.</li>
    <li> <em>Polar</em> format : the first output image will contain the <b>modulus</b> of the DFT, the second one the <b>argument</b>. The modulus image can be considered as the root square of the power spectrum of the original image. Hence it is a "even" image, while the other is an "odd" one.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>With the <em>order</em> parameter, one can choose where frequencies are located in the resulting files :
<ul>
    <li><em>Centered</em> : The DFT <b>low frequencies</b> are gathered in the center neigthborhood of the image. The FITS header is updated with the DFT_ORD keyword which parameter is the string <em>CENTERED</em>.</li>
    <li><em>Regular</em> : The DFT <b>high frequencies</b> are gathered in the center neigthborhood of the image. The FITS header is updated with the DFT_ORD keyword which parameter is the string <em>REGULAR</em>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>When the processing is complete, the displayed image is the first output image, i.e., depending on the selected format, the real part or the modulus of the DFT operator</p>
<p>The output images are encoded into unsigned 16-bits words. As the DFT result is signed, pixels values are shifted and normalised to fit the [0-32767] interval. The keywords <em>DFT_OFFS</em> and <em>DFT_NORM</em> contain respectively the shift and normalisation values.
