<h1>Preprocessing </h1>
<h2>This page needs to be translated into English.</h2>
<p><strong>We are looking for translators</strong> with English or American English as mother tongue to help us translate the help files of Audela. Please contact me (christian.jasinski@gmail.com) if you can help us in your spare time.</p>
<p>If you have installed Audela on your hard disk, the French help page (1230pretraitement.htm) to be translated can be found in the "doc_html\french\05pretraitement\" folder. Once you have translated a page, please note that the name of the file must remain the same as the French name. Put the translated English file in the "doc_html\english\05preprocessing\" folder. Please send me the page you translated (see above e-mail address) so that it is included in the next Audela version.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>In the meantime, you can have a look at the <a href="../../french/05pretraitement/1230pretraitement.htm">corresponding French help chapter.</a></strong></p>
