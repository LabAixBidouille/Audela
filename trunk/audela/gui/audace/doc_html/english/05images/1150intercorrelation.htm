<h1>Intercorrelation</h1>
<p>The input images are processed into an output image through a <b>intercorrelation</b>
operator.</p>
<p>If both input images do not have the same size, the smaller one
should be entirely contained into the biggest, i.e. <b>both</b>
dimensions of the smallest should be inferior to the dimensions of the
biggest.</p>
<p>The result of the intercorrelation processing will be displayed and
saved in the
current image directory as "<span style="font-style: italic;">correlation.fit</span>".
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If there were a file with the
very same name, its content will be overridden</span>.<br>
The output image is encoded in a floating point format. Its dynamic
range is the same as the first input image, i.e. the extrema pixels
values are unchanged.</p>
