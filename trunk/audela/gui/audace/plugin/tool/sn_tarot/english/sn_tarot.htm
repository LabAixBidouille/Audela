<h1>Tarot supernovae</h1>
<h2>This page needs to be translated into English.</h2>
<p><strong>We are looking for translators</strong> with English
or American English as mother tongue to help us translate the
help files of Audela. Please contact me
(christian.jasinski@gmail.com) if you can help us in your spare
time.</p>
<p>If you have installed Audela on your hard disk, the French
help page (sn_tarot.htm) to be translated can be found in the
"audace\plugin\tool\sn_tarot\french\" folder. Once you have
translated a page, please note that the name of the file must
remain the same as the French name. Put the translated English
file in the "audace\plugin\tool\sn_tarot\english\" folder. Please
send me the page you translated (see above e-mail address) so
that it is included in the next Audela version.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>In the meantime, you can have a look at the <a href=
"../../../tool/sn_tarot/french/sn_tarot.htm">corresponding French
help chapter.</a></strong></p>
