<h1>USB_FOCUS Focuser</h1>
<h2>This page needs to be translated into English.</h2>
<p><strong>We are looking for translators</strong> with English or
American English as mother tongue to help us translate the help files
of Audela. Please contact me (christian.jasinski@gmail.com) if you can
help us in your spare time.</p>
<p>If you have installed Audela on your hard disk, the French help page
(usb_focus.htm) to be translated can be found in the
"audace\plugin\equipment\usb_focus\french\" folder. Once you have
translated a page, please note that the name of the file must remain
the same as the French name. Put the translated English file in the
"audace\plugin\equipment\usb_focus\english\" folder. Please send me the
page you translated (see above e-mail address) so that it is included
in the next Audela version.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>In the meantime, you can have a look at the <a href="../../../equipment/usb_focus/french/usb_focus.htm">corresponding French help chapter.</a></strong></p>
