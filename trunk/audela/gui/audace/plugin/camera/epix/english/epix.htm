<h2>This page needs to be translated into English.</h2>
<p><strong>We are looking for translators</strong> with English or
American English as mother tongue to help us translate the help files
of Audela. Please contact me (christian.jasinski@gmail.com) if you can
help us in your spare time.</p>
<p>If you have installed Audela on your hard disk, the French help page
(epix.htm) to be translated can be found in the
"audace\plugin\camera\epix\french\" folder. Once you have
translated a page, please note that the name of the file must remain
the same as the French name. Put the translated English file in the
"audace\plugin\camera\epix\english\" folder. Please send me the
page you translated (see above e-mail address) so that it is included
in the next Audela version.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>In the meantime, you can have a look at the <a
 href="../../../camera/epix/french/epix.htm">corresponding
French
help chapter.</a></strong></p>
