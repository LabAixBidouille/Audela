Quadrantids (QUA)     Active: Jan 01-Jan 05     Max: Jan 03
Radiant: 230 +49      Diameter: 5               Drift: +0.8 -0.2
Velocity: 41 km/s     Population Index: 2.1     ZHR = 120


NOTES: The Quadrantids have the shortest duration of all the major showers. The short but
intense maximum can produce rates in excess of 100 meteors per hour. The shower's radiant lies in
Bootes, so is circumpolar for many northern locations, but it only attains a useful elevation after
local midnight and is highest near morning. Therefore, the shower must peak near 5 am local time in
order to see it at its best. Observing only 6 hours on either side of maximum will produce rates no
better than 20-30 meteors per hour. It appears that mass-sorting of particles across the stream of
this shower makes fainter members reach maximum up to 14 hours earlier, so observers should be
alert throughout the shower. The Quadrantids are easy to photograph at maximum, with bright yellow
fireballs being visible. Fainter shower members tend to be blue or white. The population index
varies with solar longitude.




Delta Cancrids (DCA)     Active: Jan 01-Jan 24     Max: Jan 17
Radiant: 130 +20         Diameter: 20/10           Drift: +0.9 -0.2
Velocity: 28 km/s        Population Index: 3.0     ZHR = 4


NOTES: Very little is known about this stream which can be seen from either hemisphere. It is
likely that this shower is an early part of the Virginid activity. The radiant is above the horizon
for almost the entire night, and meteors from this shower are best seen during the early to middle
part of the night. This ecliptical shower has a complex radiant structure so plotting of all
meteors is recommended.




Alpha Centaurids (ACE)     Active: Jan 28-Feb 21     Max: Feb 07
Radiant: 210 -59           Diameter: 4               Drift: +1.2 -0.3
Velocity: 56 km/s          Population Index: 2.0     ZHR = 6


NOTES: For most of the active period for this Southern Hemisphere shower, ZHRs range between 1 and
3 meteors per hour, but at maximum rates generally rise to between 5 and 10. Every 5 to 6 years,
the maximum activity seems to be enhanced and on two notable occasions in 1974 and 1980, rates
exceeded 25 meteors per hour. This enhancement has always been short-lived, lasting no more than 2
to 3 hours. This shower produces fast meteors, many with trains, and are noted for their brightly
colored fireballs.




Delta Leonids (DLE)     Active: Feb 15-Mar 10     Max: Feb 24
Radiant: 168 +16        Diameter: 5               Drift: +0.9 -0.3
Velocity: 23 km/s       Population Index: 3.0     ZHR: 2


NOTES: The Delta Leonids are thought to possibly be related to the minor planet 1987 SY and are of
average brightness, slow in speed, with very few leaving a train.




Gamma Normids (GNO)     Active: Feb 25-Mar 22     Max: Mar 13
Radiant: 249 -51        Diameter: 5               Drift: +1.1 +0.1
Velocity: 56 km/s       Population Index: 2.4     ZHR: 8


NOTES: This shower is very similar to the sporadics in appearance, and for most of their activity
period, their ZHR is almost undetectable above the background rate. The peak itself is normally
quite sharp, with ZHRs of 3+ noted for only a day or two to either side of the maximum. There are
suggestions that the activity may vary somewhat at times, with occasional broader, or less obvious,
maxima having been reported in the past. This shower is visible mainly from the Southern Hemisphere
with the radiant best placed after local midnight. Shower members are swift with the brightest
meteors often having a yellow color. The Gamma Normids are difficult to photograph due to their low
numbers and relative faintness.




Virginids (VIR)     Active: Jan 25-Apr 15     Max: several
Radiant: 195 -04    Diameter: 15/10           Drift: +0.5 -0.3
Velocity: 30 km/s   Population Index: 3.0     ZHR: 5


NOTES: As there are a large number of low activity radiants close together, it is very difficult to
distinguish what branches of the Virginids are active at any one time. With this is mind, the IMO
has for the time being incorporated all Virginids seen into one shower. They are known for their
fireball production, though their population index of 3.0 indicates there are many fainter members
as well. Radiant position listed above is for March 24.




Lyrids (LYR)             Active: Apr 16-Apr 25     Max: Apr 22
Radiant: 271 +34         Diameter: 5               Drift: +1.1 0.0
Velocity: 49 km/s        Population Index: 2.9     ZHR: 15


NOTES: This shower peaks on April 22, and produces 10 meteors per hour on average. Maximum rates
are attained for only about an hour or two at best, and can be rather erratic at times. The Lyrids
are associated with Comet Thatcher 1861 I and have produced several bursts of activity in the past.
The most recent such event occurred in 1982 when rates nearly reached 100 meteors per hour. It is
difficult to photograph the Lyrids due to their low numbers and only occasional fireballs. The
Lyrids are visible from the Southern Hemisphere, but at a much reduced rate. Useful watches can be
carried out after 2230 hours local time.




Pi Puppids (PPU)     Active: Apr 15-Apr 28     Max: Apr 23
Radiant: 110 -45     Diameter: 5               Drift: +0.6 -0.2
Velocity: 18 km/s    Population Index: 2.0     ZHR = variable


NOTES: The Pi Puppids are a meteor shower that has only recently become visible. In these cases,
the meteoroids are clustered close to their parent comet so we see activity only when their parent
comet is near the Earth. The parent comet of the Pi Puppids, 26P/Grigg-Skjellerup, returns to
perihelion every five years. Their radiant can only be effectively observed from the Southern
Hemisphere in the evening hours and sets shortly after midnight.




Eta Aquarids (ETA)     Active: Apr 19-May 28     Max: May 05
Radiant: 338 -01       Diameter: 4               Drift: +0.9 +0.4
Velocity: 66 km/s      Population Index: 2.7     ZHR: 60


NOTES: The Eta Aquarids are the outbound (post-perihelion) particles of Halley's comet. This shower
is active from mid-April through the end of May with a broad maximum which can occur anytime from
May 2 through May 10. This shower is not well observed from the Northern Hemisphere due to the low
radiant altitude when dark skies occur. An observer may see nearly 40 meteors per hour at shower
maximum from tropical latitudes, decreasing to invisibility as you approach 50 degrees north
latitude. From the Southern Hemisphere the Eta Aquarids are by far the strongest annual shower,
producing an average of 60 meteors per hour at maximum. This shower also produces the highest
percentage of trained meteors among the major showers. Nearly one-half of all Eta Aquarids produce
visible trains. There is a broad maximum with ZHRs above 30 for almost a week centered on the main
maximum.




Sagittarids (SAG)     Active: Apr 15-Jul 15     Max: several
Radiant: 247 -22      Diameter: 15/10           Drift: ?
Velocity: 30 km/s     Population Index: 2.5     ZHR: 5


NOTES: This is the radiation area of the Scorpid-Sagittarid complex. Due to the many radiants in
this area, the IMO has combined several minor showers into the Sagittarids. Observers should
monitor this shower instead of the minor radiants. The radiant position listed above is for May 19.




Pegasids (JPE)          Active: Jul 07-Jul 13     Max: Jul 10
Radiant: 340 +15        Diameter: 5               Drift: +0.8 +0.2
Velocity: 70 km/s       Population Index: 3.0     ZHR: 3


NOTES: This shower is easily missed by observers since this time of the year most northern
observers are preparing for the Perseids. The short Pegasid activity period is characterized by the
radiant being well above the horizon only in the morning hours. ZHRs are usually low. Meteors from
this stream tend to be swift and faint.




July Phoenicids (PHE)     Active: Jul 10-Jul 16     Max: Jul 14
Radiant: 32 -48           Diameter: 7               Drift: ?
Velocity: 47 km/s         Population Index: 3.0     ZHR: variable 3-10, usually ~2


NOTES: Occasionally, this shower produces enhanced activity with a ZHR of around 10, but on
average, expect ZHRs to be 4 or less. Activity is quite variable, observations show it as a richer
radio meteor source. This shower is best observed from the Southern Hemisphere after midnight.




Pisces Austrinids (PAU)     Active: Jul 15-Aug 10     Max: Jul 28
Radiant: 341 -30            Diameter: 5               Drift: +1.0 +0.2
Velocity: 35 km/s           Population Index: 3.2     ZHR: 5


NOTES: Only observers at a latitude lower than 45 degrees north should attempt observations of this
shower. Observers north of this latitude will encounter a radiant that is too low to allow reliable
observations. Expect to see only 1 or 2 meteors per hour, perhaps rising to 6 to 8 per hour at
maximum.




S. Delta Aquarids (SDA)     Active: Jul 12-Aug 19     Max: Jul 28 
Radiant: 339 -16            Diameter: 5               Drift: +0.75 +0.21
Velocity: 41 km/s           Population Index: 3.2     ZHR: 20


NOTES: This is another shower best seen from the Southern Hemisphere, where the radiant is high in
the sky during their long winter nights. This is the strongest radiant of about 6 that are active
in this region during July and August. In late July the combined count of these radiants approaches
30 meteors per hour under dark skies. Like many streams that lie close to the ecliptic, this one
possesses a double radiant. The southern branch provides a majority of the activity and reaches
maximum activity two weeks earlier than the northern branch. The average meteor from this shower is
faint and therefore difficult to photograph.




Alpha Capricornids (CAP)     Active: Jul 03-Aug 15     Max: Jul 30
Radiant: 307 -10             Diameter: 8               Drift: +0.9 +0.3
Velocity: 23 km/s            Population Index: 2.5     ZHR: 4


NOTES: This is a long-lasting shower active throughout July and August. A broad maximum occurs
during the last week of July and the first week of August centered on July 30. This shower produces
the slowest meteors of all major annual showers. Due to its southerly declination this shower is
better placed for observers in the Southern Hemisphere. This shower is noted for its bright, highly
colored fireballs that often fragment during flight. The combination of slow, bright meteors is
ideal for photography but unfortunately rates are low.




S. Iota Aquarids (SIA)     Active: Jul 25-Aug 15     Max: Aug 04
Radiant: 334 -15           Diameter: 5               Drift: +1.07 +0.18
Velocity: 34 km/s          Population Index: 2.9     ZHR: 2


NOTES: This shower is noted for its many faint meteors, making it ideal for telescopic work. It is
very difficult to distinguish members of this shower from the Delta Aquarids which are also active.
This requires careful plotting, angular velocity estimates and a center of the field of view close
to the radiant. If you do not plot meteors, it is best not to try to distinguish the different
Aquarid radiants, simply count all meteors as "Aquarids." Depending on the phase of the
moon, either the Northern or Southern branch can be observed.




N. Delta Aquarids (NDA)     Active: Jul 15-Aug 25     Max: Aug 08
Radiant: 335 -05            Diameter: 5               Drift: +0.75 +0.21
Velocity: 42 km/s           Population Index: 3.4     ZHR: 4


NOTES: See Southern Delta Aquarids.




Perseids (PER)       Active: Jul 17-Aug 24     Max: Aug 12
Radiant: 46 +57      Diameter: 5               Drift: +1.4 +0.18
Velocity: 59 km/s    Population Index: 2.6     ZHR: see Notes 


NOTES: This is the most popular meteor shower of the year due to the combination of high rates and
fair weather this time of year in much of the Northern Hemisphere. A majority of activity is
produced on August 11, 12, and 13. The shower's primary maximum has produced rates of 400+ in 1991
and 1992, around 300 in 1993, 220 in 1994 and about 160 in 1995. The return of the parent comet,
109P/Swift-Tuttle in late 1992 is almost certainly responsible for these recent outbursts, although
the material was probably laid down during the comet's previous perihelion passage in 1862. A
secondary maximum occurs with ZHRs often approaching 100 or more. The brighter members of this
shower are often colorful and produce long-lasting trains. The Perseids are easy to photograph near
the date of maximum activity. Unfortunately this shower is nearly invisible from the Southern
Hemisphere due to the northerly declination of its radiant.




Kappa Cygnids (KCG)     Active: Aug 03-Aug 25     Max: Aug 17
Radiant: 286 +59        Diameter: 6               Drift: +0.2 +0.1
Velocity: 25 km/s       Population Index: 3.0     ZHR: 3


NOTES: There is very little information concerning this shower due to its low activity. The meteors
tend to be very slow and medium bright to faint. It has been suggested that this is a fireball
shower with a periodicity of 6.6 years. But this is unproven at the present time, so many more
observations will be needed to determine if this is true. This shower is best observed from the
Northern Hemisphere.




N. Iota Aquarids (NIA)     Active: Aug 11-Aug 31     Max: Aug 19
Radiant: 327 -06           Diameter: 5               Drift: +1.03 +0.13
Velocity: 31 km/s          Population Index: 3.2     ZHR: 3


NOTES: See Southern Iota Aquarids.




Alpha Aurigids (AUR)     Active: Aug 25-Sep 05     Max: Aug 31
Radiant: 84 +42          Diameter: 5               Drift: +1.1 0.0
Velocity: 66 km/s        Population Index: 2.5     ZHR: 10


NOTES: Just as the last of the Perseid meteors are seen, the Alpha Aurigids become active. Rates
are usually low for this shower except for a period of about one hour on the morning of August 31.
If you are situated in dark morning skies when this sharp maximum occurs, you may see up to 50
shower members radiating from the "Pentagon" of Auriga. Shower members seen during this
peak of activity are often bright and leave long-lasting trains. Notable displays were seen in
1935, 1986, and 1994. The Alpha Aurigids may be particles from Comet Kiess, last seen in 1911.
Photographing the Alpha Aurigids is difficult except during the time of maximum activity.




Delta Aurigids (DAU)     Active: Sep 05-Oct 10     Max: Sep 08
Radiant: 60 +47          Diameter: 5               Drift: +1.0 +0.1
Velocity: 64 km/s        Population Index: 3.0     ZHR: 6


NOTES: The meteors from this shower are fast moving and better situated for mid-northern latitudes
where the radiant reaches a suitable elevation earlier in the night. Plotting is recommended for
this shower as much more information needs to be obtained. Observers are urged to face the
direction of the radiant in order to obtain a well-distributed sample of paths.




Piscids (SPI)        Active: Sep 01-Sep 30     Max: Sep 19
Radiant: 05 -01      Diameter: 5               Drift: +0.8 +0.2
Velocity: 26 km/s    Population Index: 3.0     ZHR: 3


NOTES: The radiant of the Piscids is well situated for Northern and Southern Hemisphere observers.
Activity is very low so care must be taken in identification to avoid sporadics being incorrectly
counted as Piscids. Meteors tend to be slow with a velocity of about 26 km/s.




Draconids (GIA)        Active: Oct 06-Oct 10     Max: Oct 9
Radiant: 262 +54       Diameter: 2               Drift: ?
Velocity: 20 km/s      Population Index: 2.6     ZHR: variable


NOTES: This is a PERIODIC shower which is visible during a short period before or after the
perihelion passage of its parent comet, 21P/Giacobini-Zinner. The radiant is circumpolar for
northern latitudes, but best placed in the early parts of the night. The theory of the evolution of
meteoroid streams support the idea that this will become an annual shower at some point, probably
several centuries in the future. But planetary perturbations may cause the stream to miss the Earth
entirely. Periodic showers such as this one prove how much regular observing is necessary to catch
unexpected returns. Negative observations are equally valuable since this helps to modify our
understanding of how meteoroid streams evolve. Outbursts of the Draconids occurred in 1933, 1946
and 1985.




Epsilon Geminids (EGE)     Active: Oct 14-Oct 27     Max: Oct 18
Radiant: 102 +27           Diameter: 5               Drift: +1.0 +0.1
Velocity: 70 km/s          Population Index: 3.0     ZHR: 2


NOTES: The maximum of this shower is not distinct and occurs around October 20. Meteors from this
shower will be very fast. Care must be used in distinguishing meteors from this radiant and that of
the Orionids.




Orionids (ORI)        Active: Oct 02-Nov 07     Max: Oct 21
Radiant: 95 +16       Diam: 10                  Drift: +0.65 +0.11
Velocity: 66 km/s     Population Index: 2.9     ZHR: 20


NOTES: The Orionids are the incoming (pre-perihelion) particles from Halley's comet. This shower is
active throughout October and reaches its maximum activity between October 17 and 25. The highest
hourly rates average near 15 but occasionally reaches 40. Most Orionid meteors are faint and
therefore difficult to photograph. This shower's radiant is located near the Celestial Equator
allowing it to be seen equally well from both hemispheres.




S. Taurids (STA)     Active: Oct 01-Nov 25     Max: Nov 05
Radiant: 50 +13      Diameter: 20/10           Drift: +0.79 +0.15
Velocity: 27 km/s    Population Index: 2.3     ZHR: 5


NOTES: These are slow, bright meteors visible during the months of October and November. This
shower has two radiants of nearly equal activity 10 degrees apart. The southern radiant reaches its
maximum activity during the first week of November, while the northern radiant peaks one week
later. The activity of this and the related Southern branch (see below) produce an apparent
plateau-like maximum for about 10 days in early November. With the radiant position reaching
culmination just after midnight, Taurid meteors can be observed for most of the night. The stream
is noted for its many brightly colored meteors although this seems to not be the case in every
year.. Although the dominant color is yellow, many orange, green, red and blue fireballs have been
recorded. The Taurids are produced by debris from Comet 2P/Encke.




N. Taurids (NTA)     Active: Oct 01-Nov 25     Max: Nov 12
Radiant: 58 +22      Diameter: 20/10           Drift: +0.76 +0.10
Velocity: 29 km/s    Population Index: 2.3     ZHR: 5


NOTES: See notes for Southern Taurids.




Leonids (LEO)         Active: Nov 14-Nov 21     Max: Nov 17
Radiant: 153 +22      Diameter: 5               Drift: +0.7 -0.4
Velocity: 71 km/s     Population Index: 2.5     ZHR: 40+


NOTES: The Leonids are a shower of short duration, lasting only one week centered on November 18.
The Leonids are particles from Comet Temple-Tuttle, which will reach perihelion in 1998. A great
concentration of particles exists near the parent comet. In years when the comet is far from the
inner solar system the activity remains below 10 meteors per hour. However, for approximately 10
years centered on the perihelion passage of Temple-Tuttle, the Leonids can produce marvelous
displays of celestial fireworks. We are now within this period of enhanced activity and one should
not miss the opportunity to watch the Leonids. During periods of high activity, the Leonids are
easy to photograph. Many shower members are bright and leave long lasting trains. The Leonid stream
collides with the earth from a head-on position that produces the highest velocity of all major
showers: 71 km/s, often producing blue, green or white meteors that frequently leave a train.
Fortunately the Leonid radiant is located close enough to the Celestial Equator that these displays
may be enjoyed by both hemispheres.




Alpha Monocerotids (AMO)     Active: Nov 15-Nov 25     Max: Nov 21
Radiant: 110 +03             Diameter: 5               Drift: +0.8 -0.2
Velocity: 65 km/s            Population Index: 2.4     ZHR: variable


NOTES: The Alpha Monocerotids are noted for their variable activity which in some years is
virtually non-existent while in others the maximum ZHR has exceeded 100 meteors per hour. Outbursts
have occurred in 1925, 1935, 1985 and 1995, suggesting a 10 year periodicity.




Chi Orionids (XOR)     Active: Nov 26-Dec 15     Max: Dec 02
Radiant: 82 +23        Diameter: 8               Drift: +1.2 0.0
Velocity: 28 km/s      Population Index: 3.0     ZHR: 3


NOTES: These meteors are well placed in the sky for both Northern and Southern Hemisphere observers
and allow many hours of observing each night. The shower has a double radiant but its southern
branch has rarely been detected. Members of this stream may be a continuation of the ecliptic
complex after the Taurids end. The radiant above is a combined one, suitable for visual work. Rates
are usually low but occasionally fireballs will occur.




Phoenicids (PHO)          Active: Nov 28-Dec 09     Max: Dec 06
Radiant: 18 -53           Diameter: 5               Drift: ?
Velocity: 18 km/s         Population Index: 2.8     ZHR: variable


NOTES: This is possibly a PERIODIC shower only visible from the Southern Hemisphere. There is a
gradual rise to a maximum on December 5, and although the maximum ZHR is usually below 3, on some
occasions much greater rates have been recorded. Only one impressive return has been reported, that
of its discovery in 1956 when rates were about 100. Three other potential bursts of lower activity
have been reported, but never by more than one observer. IMO observers have noted rates barely at
the detection limit between the years of 1988-1995, making the normal current activity almost
nonexistent.




Puppid/Velids (PUP)     Active: Dec 01-Dec 15     Max: Dec 07
Radiant: 123 -45        Diameter: 20              Drift: +0.5 0.0
Velocity: 40 km/s       Population Index: 2.9     ZHR: 10


NOTES: There are indications of a number of radiants active in the Puppis-Vela region from late
October to the end of January. Generally, this shower produces about 2 meteors per hour but rates
can exceed 5 per hour. Since several sub-centers exist, a radiant diameter of 20 degrees should be
used. Plotting is recommended. This shower is noted for its spectacular fireballs. The
Puppid/Velids are in desperate need of many more observations.




Dec. Monocerotids (MON)   Active: Nov 27-Dec 17     Max: Dec 8
Radiant: 100 +08          Diameter: 5               Drift: +0.77 +0.24
Velocity: 42 km/s         Population Index: 3.0     ZHR: 3


NOTES: The Monocerotids are observable from both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They tend
to produce low rates, on the order of 1 or 2 per hour. Care must be used when distinguishing these
meteors from the Geminids which are also active at the same time.




Sigma Hydrids (HYD)     Active: Dec 03-Dec 15     Max: Dec 11
Radiant: 127 +02        Diameter: 5               Drift: +0.7 -0.2
Velocity: 58 km/s       Population Index: 3.0     ZHR: 2


NOTES: Although first detected in the 1960s by photography, these meteors are typically swift and
faint, with rates generally low, often close to the visual detection limit. This shower is
observable from both hemispheres since the radiant is located just to the southwest of the
"head" asterism of Hydra. It is noted for production of meteors with trains, and the
shower can be best observed after local midnight right up through dawn.




Geminids (GEM)          Active: Dec 07-Dec 17     Max: Dec 13
Radiant: 112 +33        Diameter: 5               Drift: +0.97 -0.08
Velocity: 35 km/s       Population Index: 2.6     ZHR: 110


NOTES: The Geminids, with their high rates and reliability from year to year, are the shower of
choice of veteran meteor observers. This is usually the strongest shower of the year and produces
nearly 100 meteors per hour on the morning of December 14. The Geminids are visible for one week
prior to maximum, but the great majority of activity is limited to December 13 and 14. The peak has
shown slight signs of variability in time and maximum rates, and the true maximum may fall a few
hours before or after the published time. Some mass-sorting across the stream means that fainter
telescopic meteor rates are at their highest almost one degree of solar longitude ahead of the
visual peak. Telescopic observations show these meteors radiate from an elongated region, with up
to three possible sub-centers. This shower produces many bright meteors, but persistent trains are
rare. Near maximum there are many fireballs with vivid colors, especially their many bright
yellow-orange meteors, making this shower easy to photograph. The Geminids are visible from the
Southern Hemisphere, but at a greatly reduced rate. The parent object of the Geminids was unknown
until recently. However, the asteroid 3200 Phaethon, discovered by IRAS (Infrared Astronomical
Satellite) in 1983, is now known to be the source of the Geminid meteors and it is also the only
non-cometary object associated with the evolution of a major annual stream.




Coma Berenicids (COM)     Active: Dec 12-Jan 23     Max: Dec 19
Radiant: 175 +25          Diameter: 5               Drift: +0.8 -0.3
Velocity: 65 km/s         Population Index: 3.0     ZHR: 5


NOTES: The Coma Berenicids are best seen the last few hours before sunrise from the Northern
Hemisphere. Northern observers should endeavor to monitor this shower after the period of maximum
Geminid activity. Although maximum occurs in December, rates are still moderate during January.




Ursids (URS)           Active: Dec 17-Dec 26     Max: Dec 22
Radiant: 217 +76       Diameter: 5               Drift: 0.0 -0.4
Velocity: 33           Population Index: 3.0     ZHR: 10


NOTES: This shower has been poorly observed although at least two major outburst have occurred in 
1945 and 1986, and several other enhanced rates, most recently in 1988 and 1994. The parent comet
of this shower is Comet Tuttle, which last reached perihelion in 1994. An odd feature of this
shower is the apparent existence of a small condensation of material opposite the comet. A short
but strong display has been seen three times while Comet Tuttle was near aphelion, with the last
burst of activity occurring in 1986. Thus the year 2000 may provide the next possible strong
display of Ursid meteors. A great majority of the Ursid activity occurs on the morning of December
22. The Ursids display variable activity with ZHRs of around 50 being recorded on occasion. This
shower is difficult to photograph due to the low numbers and the faintness of its meteors. This
shower is invisible in the Southern Hemisphere.
