<h1>Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform</h1>
<p>The <b>Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (I-DFT)</b> translates two frequency-domain images into one spatial-domain image. Mathematically speaking, this a complex transformation. Both input images are either the real and the imaginary parts, or the modulus and the argument of a DFT. All other image couples will produce an unpredictable - and likely false - result.</p>
<p>Hence, both input images shall :
<ul>
    <li>have the very same width and height.</li>
    <li>contain a <em>DFT_ORD</em> keyword with the very same value (<em>CENTERED</em> ou <em>REGULAR</em>).</li>
    <li>contain a <em>DFT_TYPE</em> keyword with some paired values : <em>REAL</em> and <em>IMAG</em>, or <em>SPECTRUM</em> and <em>PHASE</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on the <em>DFT_ORD</em> and the <em>DFT_TYPE</em> keywords, refer to the <a href="1110TFD.htm">Discrete Fourier Transform</a> command.</p>
<p>The output image is encoded with unsigned 16-bits words.
