<h1>Cross-correlation</h1>
<p><p>The input images are processed into an output image through a <b>cross-correlation</b> operator.</p>
<p>If both input images do not have the same size, the smaller one should be entirely contained into the biggest, i.e. <b>both</b> dimensions of the smallest should be inferior to the dimensions of the biggest.</p>
<p>The output image is encoded in a floating point format. Its dynamic range is the same as the first input image, i.e. the extrema pixels values are unchanged.</p>
