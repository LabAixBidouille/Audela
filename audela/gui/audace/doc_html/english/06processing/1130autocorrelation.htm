<h1>Autocorrelation</h1>
<p>The input image is processed into an output image through an <b>autocorrelation</b>
operator.</p>
<p>The maximum output value of the auto-correlation process is located
at the output image center.</p>
<p>The output of the autocorrelation processing will be displayed and
saved in the
current image directory as "<span style="font-style: italic;">autocorrelation.fit</span>".
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">If there were a file with the
very same name, its content will be overridden</span>.<br>
The output image is encoded in a floating point format. Its dynamic
range is the same as the input image, i.e. the extrema pixels values
are unchanged.</p>
