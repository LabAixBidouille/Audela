<h1>Autoguiding</h1>
<p>Autoguiding tool allow to automatically guide from a continuous
guiding camera flow on a star kept at the same location by adjusting
the mount position. This will ensure better sleep or nice breaks
during very long exposures!</p>
<p>Guiding camera can be any camera supported by AudeLA: webcam, long
exposure webcam, grabber (ex: Watec video camera through USB
grabber), Audine, SBIG, ASCOM driven camera…</p>
<p>Your mount can be any mount supported by AudeLA with slow guiding
movements: LX200, SkySensor, Gemini, Ite-lente, Mel Bartels,
Celestron, Temma, Ouranos, AudeCom, Ascom driver...</p>

<h1><a name="start"></a>Starting</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Select a camera and a mount in menu <b>Setup
&gt;Camera</b> (or Camera &gt; Connection) and <b>Setup &gt; Mount</b>
(or Telescope &gt; Connection) in AudeLA. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select menu <b>Telescope &gt; Autoguiding</b></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: you can use a second camera for autoguiding and open a
second Visu (Visu2) to keep Visu1 for the main acquisition. If you
select the Autoguiding tool in that second Visu, it will reopen
automatically next time you connect your guiding camera.</p>
<h1><a name="param_principal"></a>Setting up acquisition parameters</h1>
<p>Acquisition parameters are displayed on the main screen of the
autoguiding tool:</p>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="mainframe.png" name="images1" align="BOTTOM"
 border="0" width="636" height="449">
</p>
<p align="CENTER">Exemple of guiding on double star (Castor).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Exp.</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">: exposure time in
seconds</span>.</p>
<p><b>Interval</b> : Waiting time between exposures; use 0.5 to begin
with (see Tips &amp; Tricks).</p>
<p><b>Consign</b> : Target position for the guiding star; this is
mainly used in spectroscopy to bring the target on a specific
location (slit or optical fiber hole). Could be sub-pixel values is
required. The target position is shown as the center of the blue
cross. You can also change this location by left clicking on one of
the blue axis and move the mouse around.</p>
<p><b>option "Axes (AD, Déc.)" </b>: display the
blue axis whose center indicates the target location for the guiding
star.</p>
<p><b>option "tracking On"</b> : Guiding movements are sent
to the mount only when this option is set ON. You can activate or
desactivate this option anytime. <font color="#993300">For safety
reasons, this option is set OFF when you maunch the autoguiding tool
to avoid unwanted movements. Also, MAKE SURE TO SET TRACKING OFF when
performing a GoTo on your next target – this is common mistake
and some mount do not like receiving guiding movement while slewing
on the sky...</font> It is recommended to set tracking ON after have
the autoguiding configured (you can actually changed the parameters
while autoguiding is ON).</p>
<p><b>Deviation </b>: Difference in X &amp; Y position between the
guiding star and the target position.</p>
<p><b>Pulse.</b> : Pulse duration sent to motors RA &amp; Dec. Value
displayed is in milliseconds followed by direction (n=north, s=south,
e=east, w=west).</p>
<p><b>Interval</b> : Total duration between two movements (in
milliseconds).</p>

<h1><a name="configure"></a>Configuring autoguiding<br>
</h1>
<h2 class="western"><a name="autoguidage_etoile"></a>a) Autoguiding on
star</h2>
<p>You can change the autoguiding parameters by clicking on
«&nbsp;Setup&nbsp;». This opens a new window:</p>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="configframe-star.png" name="images2"
 align="BOTTOM" border="0" width="318" height="456"></p>
<p><b>Area size (in pixels)</b><br>
You can change the size of the <b>red
square</b> which defines the area where the software look for the
guiding star. Increase this area if you have a bad tracking, bad
seeing or cloudy skies; reduce this area if you have a good tracking
and a double star for exemple (to select the right star and stay on
it). This square is redrawn after each image acquisition:</p>
<blockquote><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000"><img
 src="star-target.png" name="images3" align="BOTTOM" border="3"
 width="93" height="90"></font></font></blockquote>
<p><b>Detection threshold (pixels)</b><br>
This parameters indicates
if a guiding star is detected or not.</p>
<p>The key figure is the number of pixels above <b>minIntensity =
dbgmean + 6.0 * dbgsigma</b>&nbsp; <br>
with dbgmean : average
background value in the red square (searching area)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
dbsigma&nbsp; : standard deviation of the sky background in this
searching area</p>
<p>When the searching area includes a number of pixels below
minIntensity, the software consideres thay the star is not visible
(sky becoming cloudy for exemple) and stop sending guiding movement
to the mount until this value get back above the min Intensity.
Intensity indicator is displayed in red in the autoguiding pannel and
some help caption is displayed if you move your mouse on it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.06cm;"><img src="configframe-detection.png"
 name="images4" align="BOTTOM" border="0" width="266" height="98"></p>
<p>If the detection threshold is set to 0 (zero), guiding movement
are always sent to the mount even is no star is detected.</p>
<p><b>Speed (in pixels/ms)</b><br>
Coefficient to convert number of
pixels in pulse duration (in millisecond) to send to the mount. Start
with 10 on each axis then increase or descrease the value depending
on mount reaction to guiding movements.</p>
<p><b>Threshold (inn pixels)</b><br>
Below this distance, no movement
is sent to the motor (to avoid back &amp; forth movement). A good
value is 1 pixel usually.</p>
<p><b>Angle (in degrees)</b><br>
Camera inclination from RA axis.</p>
<h2><a name="autoguidage_fente"></a>b) Autoguiding on spectrograph slit</h2>
<h3 class="western">Key principles</h3>
<blockquote><b>Algorythm </b>: </blockquote>
<blockquote>- Measure received flux in two areas above &amp; below
the slit (defined by the target position and the slit width
parameter) <br>
- Calculate the percentage of flux between those tao
areas <br>
- Multiply the step percentage by the %/pixel ratio to
convert this value in a pixel shift of the guiding star in the image.
  <br>
- Divide this value by the speed (pixels/sec) to get the pulse
duration to send to the Dec motor of the mount </blockquote>
<blockquote>If the star get too far from the slit (&gt; width of the
slit edge), the software switchs back to standard star guiding mode
(gaussian adjustement).</blockquote>
<h3 class="western">Setting up
slit autoguiding</h3>
<p>Select «&nbsp;slit&nbsp;» in the parameter Setup
window.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><img src="configframe-slit.png" name="images5"
 align="BOTTOM" border="0" width="318" height="456"></p>
<p align="CENTER">Default values for a C8 + Lhires III + webcam</p>
<p><b>Area size (in pixels)</b><br>
Define the total size of the two
rectangles limiting the searching areas. Those rectangles are redrawn
after each image acquisition:</p>
<blockquote><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000"><img
 src="slit-target.png" name="images6" align="BOTTOM" border="3"
 width="134" height="106"></font></font></blockquote>
<p><b>slit Width (in pixels)</b><br>
Spacing between the two
rectangle, defining the slit dark area. Flux received in this area is
not taken into account in the flux measurement.</p>
<p><b>Ratio (%/pixel)</b><br>
Ratio used to convert flux percentage
into pixel shift.</p>
<p><b>Angle (in degrés)</b><font color="#993300"><br>
«&nbsp;Angle&nbsp;»
IS NOT USED in slit guiding mode. You have to align the slit with the
X axis of the image. A rotation of few degrees is allowed.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>Other parameters are the same as in star
autoguiding mode (PSF: Point Spread Function, gaussian model) –
see above.</b></font></p>
<h2><a name="apprentissage"></a>c) Learning (optional) </h2>
<p>Learning allows to find the RA &amp; Dec speed as well as the
camera angle. Set a delay for the pulse (in seconds). The software
will ask you to click on the star after each acquisition. Make sure
the backlash of your mount is properly adjusted for best results.</p>
<blockquote>... to be completed...</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="pre-traitement"></a>d) Image preprocessing (optional)</h2>
<p><b>Add exposures </b>
</p>
<blockquote>This option allows you to add multiple exposures before
calculating the guiding movement to make. Useful when you camera
doesn't have long exposure mode and for faint targets.</blockquote>
<p><b>Dark frame substraction </b>
</p>
<blockquote>This option will allow to remove a dark frame before
calculating the guiding movement to make. This is very useful for
some noisy camera to eliminate hot pixels (ex: long exposure webcam,
PL1M or QHY5 cameras...).</blockquote>
<h1><a name="demarrage"></a>Running autoguiding</h1>
<p>- Run continuous acquisition (GO CCD button on main panel)</p>
<p>- Click &amp; Drag the blue axis to the desired target position</p>
<p>- Double Left Click on the guide star to set the searching area
(red square) on the guiding star even if far from the target
position; check that the red square follows the star movement
(otherwise look at the detection threshold value)</p>
<p>- Activate the Tracking ON</p>
<p>- Monitor the movement of your guiding star and the pulses sent to
the mount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a name="correction"></a>Corrections during autoguiding</h1>
<p>All those parameters can be modified during autoguiding (no need
to stop it to change one of them). <br>
Exemples :</p>
<blockquote><b>Change the target position during the autoguiding</b>
: in spectrography, this allows to move the target position right on
the slit; this can be seen when the star almost disapears in the slit
and the flux on each side is minimum. Make sure to adjust your camera
setting so the guiding star doesn't saturate (a Watec 120N+ video
camera is best as you can adjust exposure and gain very precisely).
Leave some intensity room if you sky is not too clear.</blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Direction</b> : if your guiding star moves to the
wrong direction, change the direction of the guiding on the
corresponding axis. This is the case on german mount when you do a
pier side switch.</blockquote>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<h1><a name="recommandation"></a>Tips &amp; Tricks</h1>
<p><br>
<b>=&gt; Do not saturate the guiding star </b>
</p>
<blockquote>A saturated star won't allow a precise guiding. Shoot for
an intensity around 200 if saturation level is 255...</blockquote>
<p><b>=&gt; Take long exposure to integrate in bad seeing</b></p>
<blockquote>Ideally 1 to 2 sec exposure time but of course you have
to avoid saturation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If exposure time is too short, best is to cumulate
exposures to avoid guiding on turbulences...</blockquote>
<p>=&gt; I<b>f your mount is tracking well</b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.06cm;">Best is to increase the interval
between exposures to limit wring guiding movement due to turbulence.</p>
<p>=&gt; <b>Use your mount PEC</b> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 1.06cm;">After some experiment, we have found
the PID integration algorythm was not a good option to keep as it was
conflicting with mount PEC. Final result seems better with mount PEC
activated.</p>
<p>=&gt; <b>Slightly unbalance your mount</b> (or a small polar
misalignment) is best if your mount has some backlash in order to
have guiding movement always in the same direction. This is also true
in case of manual guiding by the way! Specially in Dec.</p>
<p><b>=&gt; Note on spectrograph slit guiding</b></p>
<blockquote>Ratio %/pixel can have a value between 0.5 and 50 ! We
haven't found a way to calculate this paramter automatically. It
depends on star luminosity, sky background, ratio between those two
values and also on the rectangle size...</blockquote>
<blockquote>When this ratio is too low, Dec movements are too slow or
even null.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When this ratio is too high, Dec movements are too large
and provoques oscillations.</blockquote>
