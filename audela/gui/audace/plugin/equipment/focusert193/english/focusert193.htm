<h1>T193 Focuser </h1>
<h2>This page needs to be translated into English.</h2>
<p><strong>We are looking for translators</strong> with English or American English as mother tongue to help us translate the help files of Audela. Please contact me (christian.jasinski@gmail.com) if you can help us in your spare time.</p>
<p>If you have installed Audela on your hard disk, the French help page (focusert193.htm) to be translated can be found in the "audace\plugin\equipment\focusert193\french\" folder. Once you have translated a page, please note that the name of the file must remain the same as the French name. Put the translated English file in the "audace\plugin\equipment\focusert193\english\" folder. Please send me the page you translated (see above e-mail address) so that it is included in the next Audela version.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>In the meantime, you can have a look at the <a href="../../../equipment/focusert193/french/focusert193.htm">corresponding French help chapter.</a></strong></p>
