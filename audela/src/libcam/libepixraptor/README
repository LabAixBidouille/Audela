The library libepix.so is thought to control all the cameras that use an EPIX PIXCI card in their acquisition system.

The current version only supports the camera RAPTOR Osprey OS4MPc-CL. Indeed, the acquisition is controlled by libkxclib, but the configuration of the different parameters of the acquisition is different for every camera.
This version mixes camera-dependent and camera-independent code.

The final system will have an interface common to all the cameras and some functions that implement the comunication protocol with the camera itself.
The choice of the functions behind the interface will be performed at the configuration of the camera (probably using pointers to functions).
