The library libepixraptor.so supports the camera RAPTOR Osprey OS4MPc-CL. Indeed, the acquisition is controlled by libkxclib, but the configuration of the different parameters of the acquisition is different for every camera.
This version mixes camera-dependent and camera-independent code.

The camera dependent code consists on the communication protocol between the software and the camera and on some camera parameters.

If you want to add another camera that uses the same acquisition card, you must create a folder "libepixOTHER" and copy there the content of libepixraptor.
Then, you must rewrite the files "raptor.c" and "serial.c", that contain the communication protocol, and possibly modify the files "raptor.h", "serial.h", "camera.h" and "camera.c" if you must change the interface for communicating with the camera.
