Meinberg utils:
  acq.py: script that displays the status of the meinberg (mbgstatus -vvv) and can
          save the incoming timestamps in the time buffer (START -> gpscap -f ?filename?).
          It requires "mbgstatus" to be present in the system.
  gpscap: similar to the Meinberg command "mbggpscap -c"; it resets the buffer before
          starting; it has the "-f" option for putting the output into a file; it does
          not print the mbggpscap header.

Compilation and installation:
  acq.py: go into acq/ and type "make install" as root; it is installed in /usr/local/bin;
          it needs "gpscap" to work fully (otherwise, the button START does not work).
  gpscap: type "make" and "make install" (the latter must be executed as root). It
          installs in "/usr/local/bin/"
