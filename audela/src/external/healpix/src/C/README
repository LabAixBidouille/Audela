Compilation and Installation
----------------------------

See the header in the 'subs/Makefile'.

You can alternatively try to run the script 'doinstall'

Usage
-----

To use in your 'c' code, include the line
 
#include "chealpix.h"
 
in your code and link with something like 
 
gcc -o myprog myprog.c -I<incdir> -L<libdir> -lchealpix

where <incdir> is where you've installed the '.h' files and 
<libdir> is where you've installed the libraries (See the header of 
the 'Makefile').

You will also need the 'cfitsio' library. See 
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html

Disclaimer and Acknowledgements:
--------------------------------

The software is almost wholely work done by others. The original HEALPix
software was written by Gorski, Hivon, Hansen, Stompor, Banday and
Bartelmann. The 'C' routines were taken from Reza Ansari's C++ libraries
that are being created for Planck.

Ken Ganga has made minor modifications to the Ansari code to make it work in
'C'.
