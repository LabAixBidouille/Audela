    <ol>
<li><p><b>Q: Can you send me a copy of fly via email?</b></p>
    <p>A: Not right now. Maybe later.
    </p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Q: All these different copies of fly are confusing. I'm using a
       Windoze 99 computer and my ISP has Lunix. What version of fly do I
       need?</b></p>
    <p>A: Check with your Internet Service Provider to see what version of
       unix and on what platform they are running. You should then be able
       to <a href="installation.html">download</a> the appropriate
       pre-compiled copy of fly. You might even like to ask them to install
       it for you. If no pre-compiled copy is available, you should ask them
       to compile and install it.
    </p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Q: I'm using a Silicone Picture RSA4500 computer running Lunix.
          Do you have a copy of fly compiled for my platform?</b></p>
    <p>A: If it's not on the <a
       href="installation.html">Download
       and Installation</a> page, the answer is no. Check with your
       Internet Service Provider or System Administrator to see if they will
       compile it for you.
</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Q: How can I create animated GIFs with fly?</b></p>
    <p>A: You can create the still images with fly, and then join them
       together with a tool like <a href="http://www.msg.net/utility/whirlgif/"
       >whirlgif</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Q: I can't get this counter program to work. What's wrong?</b></p>
    <p>A: Probably nothing is wrong with fly. To check that fly is working,
       change to the directory where it is located and type <kbd>./fly -h</kbd>
       and you should get a 'Quick Reference to Directives' screen.
    </p>
    <p>Please note that I am not the author of any counter program. In fact,
       I strongly recommend against using them. Use a web log analysis program
       like <a href="http://martin.gleeson.com/pwebstats/">pwebstats.</a> At
       any rate, I can not offer any support for a program that was written by
       someone else. Please do not email me asking to get your counter
       working, because all you will get is the URL of this page.
       Contact the author of the counter program, or try to work out the
       problem yourself. General CGI debugging information is available at
       &lt;<a href="http://www.cgi-resources.com/"
       >http://www.cgi-resources.com/</a>&gt;.
    </p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Q: I'm using fly on Windows and the images are corrupted.
       What's wrong?</b></p>
    <p>A: Windows needs to have output files opened in binary mode. See the
    following perl example from the Perl for Win32 FAQ
    <a href="http://www.activestate.com/support/faqs/win32/perlwin32faq7.html"
    >http://www.activestate.com/support/faqs/win32/perlwin32faq7.html.</a>

7.3. How do I return a graphics file from a CGI script?

One of the big differences between UNIX and Win32 platforms is
that on Win32 there's a difference between text or ASCII files
and binary file. To return a graphics file, you need to specify
that the file is a binary file, and that the standard output
stream should accept binary data. Try something like this: 

    $MY_FILE_NAME = 'Penelope.jpg';
    $CHUNK_SIZE = 4096;

    open( MY_FILE, &quot;&lt;$MY_FILE_NAME&quot; )
         or die( &quot;Can't open $MY_FILE_NAME: $!\n&quot; );

    print &quot;Content-type: image/jpeg\r\n&quot;;
    print &quot;\r\n&quot;;

<b>    binmode( MY_FILE ); # These are crucial!
    binmode( STDOUT ); </b>

    while ( $cb = read( MY_FILE, $data, $CHUNK_SIZE ) )
    {
        print $data;
    }

    close( MY_FILE );
