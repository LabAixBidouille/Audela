VERSIONS, PORTS

This is release 1.50 of msqltcl. It has been tested with Tcl 7.3,
Tk 3.6p1, TclX 7.3a-p2; Tcl 7.4b2, Tk 4.0b2, TclX 7.4a-b2, mSQL 1.0.6
under SunOS 4.1.3. Successful ports to several other platforms have
been reported. I would expect msqltcl to run wherever Tcl/Tk and mSQL
succeed.


WHAT IS MSQLTCL?

Msqltcl is an extension to the Tool Command Language (Tcl) that
provides high-level access to a Mini SQL (mSQL) database server. Mini
SQL (mSQL) is a freely available, lightweight database engine.

Msqltcl features:
   -- supports multiple connections to one or more database servers,
   -- supports all Mini-SQL statements,
   -- returns SELECT query results either as Tcl lists, or iterates
      a script over the resulting rows,
   -- accesses information about databases, tables, columns.

The package also contains a useful Mini-Monitor (mmon) written in
Tcl/Tk. It requires TclX and is currently limited to pre-4.0 Tk.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Obviously msqltcl is just a small addition to a much greater work done
by John Ousterhout (Tcl/Tk) and David J. Hughes (mSQL).

Msqltcl is derived from work by Tom Poindexter (tpoindex@nyx.cs.du.edu)
whose Sybtcl and Oratcl are useful patterns for Tcl database extensions.


DOCUMENTATION

Yes, a decent man page.


REQUIREMENTS

You must have Tcl/Tk and Mini SQL.

** Tcl/Tk by John Ousterhout is available from numerous FTP sites. For
one-stop retrieval, look in ftp.aud.alcatel.com:/tcl. You will find
the Tcl/Tk distribution in /tcl/ftp.cs.berkeley.edu, extensions (one
of which is msqltcl) in /tcl/extensions. You may want to get the file
/tcl/MIRRORS to discover a mirror site near you.

The Tcl/Tk Book is "Tcl and the Tk Toolkit" by John K. Ousterhout,
Addison-Wesley 1994, ISBN 0-201-63337-X.

** Mini SQL (mSQL) is a freely available, lightweight database engine
developed by David J. Hughes, Bond University, Australia. The source
code can be obtained by FTP from Bond.edu.au:/pub/Minerva/msql.

There is an mSQL mailing list. Join it by sending a message to
msql-list-request@Bond.edu.au.


INSTALLATION

See the file INSTALL.


BUG REPORTS

Although I have made a conscientious effort to provide zero-defect
software and documentation, this release of msqltcl may still contain
blunders of varying magnitudes.

Comments, suggestions, bug reports (maybe even encouragement!) should be
mailed to me at the E-mail address above. Please include some
information about your environment (platform, OS version, Tcl/Tk
version, mSQL version, msqltcl version). Please include enough
information for me to be able to reproduce any suspect behaviour. If you
have a solution to a problem, please include a patch.

I can't guarantee that I will fix your bug, but I'll do my best.
