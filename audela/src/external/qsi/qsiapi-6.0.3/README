Install libusb-1.0 (version 1.0 or later) and libftd2xx (version 1.0.4 or greater) prior to building this package.

Ubuntu users should insure that the build-essential package has been installed:
apt-get install build-essential

Installation

Insure that the kernel is configured for USB support and the device permissions are correct. 

With root permissions:

Download, compile, and install libftd2xx. (Available at: http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm )

Modify the ftdi_table file provided in the libftd2xx release, to include the VIDs and PIDs for QSI cameras.  
Compile and install it as directed by the README from the libftdi release.  For more information see the
installation section of the QSI Linux API reference manual located in the doc directory of the release.

Insure that libusb-1.0 is installed, as required by libftd2xx.

Extract the release files from the qsiapi tar archive.
	gunzip qsiapi.5.7.0.0.tar.gz
	tar xvf qsiapi.5.7.0.0.tar
	
Run the GNU development tools:
	
	In the extracted qsiapi.5.7.0.0 directory
	
	./configure
	make all
	make install
	
You may need to install the g++ compiler and other build tools to run the above. If so, run: 
	apt-get install build-essential

Confirm the installation of the include and library files.
	The include files qsiapi.h and QSIError.h are installed in /usr/local/include. 
	The libraries libqsiapi.so, libqsiapi.a, etc. are installed in /usr/local/lib. 

Run ldconfig for the newly installed libraries:
	cd /usr/local/lib
	ldconfig /usr/local/lib

Add the following line to /etc/fstab (if it does not already exist):
	none /proc/bus/usb usbfs defaults,devmode=0666 0 0

Remount all in the fstab file
	mount -a
	
Connect the QSI camera to AC power and connect the USB cable from the camera to an available 
USB port on the computer. Use usbview (available at http://www.kroah.com/linux-usb/) or lsusb 
to verify proper USB installation.

Confirm that all libraries are loaded and the system is properly configured.
	qsiapitest
	
	qsiapitest first displays the version of the api. If there is a QSI camera connected to the system, 
	it will execute a series of command to exercise the camera. See the qsiapitest.cpp source code for further details.

Troubleshooting:

If you have problems with the installation steps above, first use usbview or lsusb to
 confirm that the USB file system is mounted properly and the QSI camera is connected to the system.

Some problems may be related to the ftdi_sio driver loading. You must unload this driver (and usbserial)
 if it is attached to your device ("rmmod ftdi_sio" and "rmmod usbserial"as root user).

Insure that the user running the api has read/write access to the camera usb raw device. Check the permissions
 in /dev/bus/usb/XXX/YYY, where XXX is a hub number and YYY is the device number obtained from lsusb.


To set device persmissions other than root:

udev changes:

For example, to give rw access rights to all users for all QSI USB cameras in Fedora:

In the file /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev-rules,

after:
"Persistent block device stuff - end"
and before:
ACTION="add", SUBSYSTEM='usb-device'...

Add the following lines:
ACTION="add", SUBSYSTEM=usb-device', \
SYSFS{idVendor}=="0403", SYSFS{idProduct}=="eb48", \
PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c 'K=%k; K=$${K#usbdev}; printf bus/usb/%%03i/%%03i $${K%%%%.*} $${K#*.}' ", \
NAME="%c", MODE="0666"

In Ubuntu 6:

In the file /etc/udev/rules.d/40-permisssions.rules

after:
#USB devices (usbfs replacement)
SUBSYSTEM=usb_device, MODE=0664

Add the following line:
SUBSYSTEM=usb_device, SYSFS{idVendor}==0403, SYSFS{idProduct}== eb48, MODE=0666
